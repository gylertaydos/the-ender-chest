<p><subtitle>jazz music playing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:09</timestamp>
<p>I think, the most important thing here
is that we're honest with each other
and ourselves. Do you agree?
</p><timestamp>00:00:14</timestamp>
<p>Uh, yes?
</p><timestamp>00:00:15</timestamp>
<p>It says, here, you failed
your last six health inspections.
</p><timestamp>00:00:18</timestamp>
<p>-Ooh.
-How are you still in business?
</p><timestamp>00:00:19</timestamp>
<p>I wanna say moxie?
But possibly spunk.
</p><timestamp>00:00:23</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> I can't believe
I fell asleep at your house.
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p>-These shoots are messing up my rhythm.
-It's so weird waking up at 6:00 p.m.
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>Don't worry. I'm not gonna make a habit
of spending the night or day.
</p><timestamp>00:00:32</timestamp>
<p>I get it. We work together,
we make sex together,
we don't talk about feelings,
and yet sometimes
a begrudging respect can blossom into--
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>-Nope.
-"Blossoms into nothing"
is what I was gonna say.
</p><timestamp>00:00:41</timestamp>
<p>You cut me off, so you look stupid.
</p><timestamp>00:00:44</timestamp>
<p>Well, you look stupid when you sleep.
Look, I took some dumb pictures.
</p><timestamp>00:00:47</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> All right.
-Stupid. Real stupid.
</p><timestamp>00:00:49</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> You can delete some.
-You have a weird eye.
</p><timestamp>00:00:51</timestamp>
<p>-Obsessed much?
-This is what it would look like
if corpses could drool. <subtitle>laughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:55</timestamp>
<p>-Hi, excuse me, can I get <i>The BoJack?</i>
-What is that?
</p><timestamp>00:00:57</timestamp>
<p>It's an off-the-menu item
for those in the know.
</p><timestamp>00:01:00</timestamp>
<p>Obviously, I'm BoJack
and I always order the BoJack sandwich.
</p><timestamp>00:01:03</timestamp>
<p>That's kooky.
</p><timestamp>00:01:04</timestamp>
<p>Why would your name be a sandwich name?
</p><timestamp>00:01:07</timestamp>
<p>Because I own this restaurant
and I'm a celebrity.
</p><timestamp>00:01:09</timestamp>
<p>So, are all sandwiches named
after celebrities?
</p><timestamp>00:01:13</timestamp>
<p>Is chicken salad a celebrity?
</p><timestamp>00:01:14</timestamp>
<p>No, that's just a thing
they put in the sandwich.
</p><timestamp>00:01:17</timestamp>
<p>That's not someone's name.
</p><timestamp>00:01:18</timestamp>
<p>Can't it be both? My name is Pickles.
</p><timestamp>00:01:20</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-I'll have a burger.
</p><timestamp>00:01:21</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I'm going to the can.
Have fun with the waitress.
</p><timestamp>00:01:24</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>water running</subtitle>
-<subtitle>humming rhythmically</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:29</timestamp>
<p>-Um.
-It's me, Pickles, from before.
</p><timestamp>00:01:31</timestamp>
<p>-It's cool dating a celebrity.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:01:33</timestamp>
<p>I'm also dating a celebrity.
Should we start a club?
</p><timestamp>00:01:35</timestamp>
<p>-I call vice president.
-I'm not dating anyone.
</p><timestamp>00:01:38</timestamp>
<p>And if I had to guess,
I'd say neither are you.
</p><timestamp>00:01:40</timestamp>
<p>Guys in this town, especially celebrities,
are not exactly the settle-down type.
</p><timestamp>00:01:44</timestamp>
<p>That's why I hit the jackpot with my guy.
He doesn't have a problem committing.
</p><timestamp>00:01:47</timestamp>
<p>In fact,
he just got out of his third marriage.
</p><timestamp>00:01:50</timestamp>
<p>A celebrity who just got divorced.
Yeah. No way he'll break your heart.
</p><timestamp>00:01:54</timestamp>
<p>Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter and I
are moving too fast?
</p><timestamp>00:01:57</timestamp>
<p>I don't know you or your relationship,
but I have been around the block
a few times.
</p><timestamp>00:02:01</timestamp>
<p>I was even on an ABC procedural,
called <i>The Block,</i> which aired a few times.
</p><timestamp>00:02:04</timestamp>
<p>The key is to have zero expectations,
and then you'll never be disappointed.
</p><timestamp>00:02:09</timestamp>
<p>Hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:02:10</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, zero expectations,
which also seems to be the mantra
of this restaurant.
</p><timestamp>00:02:15</timestamp>
<p>Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:02:16</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>theme music</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:13</timestamp>
<p>She looks dead.
</p><timestamp>00:03:14</timestamp>
<p>But I'm not a doctor, I'm a sassy cop.
</p><timestamp>00:03:16</timestamp>
<p>Poor girl had dreams.
</p><timestamp>00:03:17</timestamp>
<p>And there's nothing more precious
than dreams.
</p><timestamp>00:03:20</timestamp>
<p>Philbert takes a drag of his cigarette,
then kneels down to inspect the corpse.
</p><timestamp>00:03:24</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:03:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}BoJack,
you said the stage directions again.
</p><timestamp>00:03:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Sorry. My brain is kinda muddled.
It's these night shoots.
</p><timestamp>00:03:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I think it works.
</p><timestamp>00:03:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}John Philbert doesn't play by the rules.
He says his stage directions out loud.
</p><timestamp>00:03:36</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}It's confusing, which means
the show is daring and smart.
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Hey, wanna go check out craft services?
-Mm-mm.
</p><timestamp>00:03:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}How could whatever you're listening to
be more fun
</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}than hearing me rant
about the fruit spread?
</p><timestamp>00:03:45</timestamp>
<p>Is your rant honeydew related?
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>It's in the honeydew area,
but the specifics are
what keep it fresh each time.
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>Uh-huh.

<p>{\an8}-Are you ready to go?
-Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:03:58</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Sorry, I didn't realize how late it got.
</p><timestamp>00:04:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}If only there was an easy way
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}to keep track
of what time it is right now.
</p><timestamp>00:04:04</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-I'll go change.
-No, keep your suit on.
</p><timestamp>00:04:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}My parents are gonna be impressed
I'm dating an executive.
</p><timestamp>00:04:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Cool!
I've never impressed parents before.
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I believe that.
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Listen, I haven't told my family
I'm asexual,
so it might be best if, for tonight,
we just pretend we're sexually active.
</p><timestamp>00:04:20</timestamp>
<p>I mean, it's a family dinner.
</p><timestamp>00:04:21</timestamp>
<p>What are the odds they're going to ask
questions about our sexuality, right?
</p><timestamp>00:04:25</timestamp>
<p>Right...
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>mystery music</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:28</timestamp>
<p>Right.
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>Yeah...
</p><timestamp>00:04:33</timestamp>
<p>Yeah.
</p><timestamp>00:04:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-<subtitle>Pickles</subtitle> Hmm.
-Aha! Whoa. Slow down.
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Stop. We're here.
-Mr. Peanutbutter?
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Am I Steve Carell taking a dramatic role
in <i>Little Miss Sunshine,</i>
and you are the American public
that only knows him for his comedic work?
</p><timestamp>00:04:48</timestamp>
<p>Because... surprise!
</p><timestamp>00:04:50</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God. Are you the umlaut
in Chloë Sevigny's name, right now?
</p><timestamp>00:04:54</timestamp>
<p>Because I don't know why you're here,
but I'm glad you are.
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p>As Courteney Cox said when she discovered
a rotting corpse in the woods
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}near the <i>Cougar Town </i>set,
"Good God, I hope you're not busy."
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-What?
-This is a thinker.
</p><timestamp>00:05:04</timestamp>
<p>-You'll get it later.
-Okay.
</p><timestamp>00:05:05</timestamp>
<p>I have a very fun plan for tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:05:07</timestamp>
<p>I just heard that they're going to blow up
the International Space Station.
</p><timestamp>00:05:11</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, my God. Blow it up? Why?
-No one knows why space people do things.
</p><timestamp>00:05:15</timestamp>
<p>But I thought we could road trip
out to the desert
and witness the explosion
in all her glory.
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>That sounds amazing!
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>
<p>I'm so glad you're as excited as I am,
and not mad at me
for trying to surprise you
with something nice.
</p><timestamp>00:05:27</timestamp>
<p>Yeah! But... are we moving too fast?
</p><timestamp>00:05:31</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}A wise lady, in the bathroom,
told me some stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:05:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Ooh, she sounds smart. Better listen.
-I think her name was Hamburger.
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Maybe we should wait, some days,
before going on another date.
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>Okay. If that's how you feel,
you stay here and do nothing,
and I'll go have this amazing,
once-in-a-lifetime experience
all by myself.
</p><timestamp>00:05:46</timestamp>
<p>It does sound cool.
I could also drive to the desert.
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>If we're both going,
we might as well carpool.
</p><timestamp>00:05:52</timestamp>
<p>That's smart! But just to be clear,
we're slowing things down.
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>It's not a date.
</p><timestamp>00:05:57</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> Exactly.
</p><timestamp>00:05:58</timestamp>
<p>Is this that mysterious,
brown hors d'oeuvre
</p><timestamp>00:06:00</timestamp>
<p>I ate at Mark McGrath's pool party,
last week?
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>Because... oh, boy. Not a date.
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>

of acceptable melons.

<p>-Hey! No... Ugh!
-<subtitle>musical playing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:17</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle> What is this?
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>-This is so corny.
-It's not corny.
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>I mean,
it's technically a musical about corn,
but it's actually sophisticated.
</p><timestamp>00:06:24</timestamp>
<p>Wait a second.
Are you... into musicals?
</p><timestamp>00:06:27</timestamp>
<p>I sense you'll make this a thing.
</p><timestamp>00:06:29</timestamp>
<p>Well, well, well, the stone-hearted cynic,
who thinks feelings are for suckers,
has a secret soft spot for sappy musicals.
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>-Okay.
-When you say, "Okay,"
do you mean okay like "correct,"
or okay like "OK-lahoma"?

<p>That's very impressive.

<p>I'm afraid we don't know a lot
about the world of big business.
</p><timestamp>00:08:20</timestamp>
<p>As I'm sure Yolanda has told you,
</p><timestamp>00:08:21</timestamp>
<p>I'm but a humble,
best-selling, erotic novelist
and my wife is a world-famous,
adult, film star,
and Yolanda's identical twin sister,
Mindy, is a sex advice columnist.
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p>Wow! Yolanda told me all of that.
</p><timestamp>00:08:33</timestamp>
<p>That's all really great information,
that I was already privy to.
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>Well, the important thing is
that Yolanda is happy
and she's finally found a man, woman,
or object to have sex with.
</p><timestamp>00:08:45</timestamp>
<p>Todd is very accomplished
at sexual intercourse. Aren't you, Todd?
</p><timestamp>00:08:48</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I'm the best at the sex.
Hooba, hooba.
</p><timestamp>00:08:51</timestamp>
<p>Um...
</p><timestamp>00:08:52</timestamp>
<p>-Are you trying to say "hubba, hubba"?

of a reputation, myself. <subtitle>moans</subtitle>

<p>-Whoa!
-Okay, we should be hitting the road.
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>Oh, but you must stay for erotic dessert.
</p><timestamp>00:09:03</timestamp>
<p>You know, I saw the erotic dessert
in the kitchen.
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>Who knew you could make
such a realistic anus out of marzipan?
</p><timestamp>00:09:10</timestamp>
<p>You can thank my husband.
He posed for the baker.
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>
<p>Wow, you know,
it really puts the "um" in "yum."
</p><timestamp>00:09:17</timestamp>
<p>I insist you spend the night
and make love in my home.
</p><timestamp>00:09:20</timestamp>
<p>-Uh...
-I can't think of a reason,
you wouldn't want to have sex
in your parents' house.
</p><timestamp>00:09:25</timestamp>
<p>Unless, you don't enjoy sex.
</p><timestamp>00:09:27</timestamp>

<p>Hey, I got a suggestion for that scene
where you make your big confession.
</p><timestamp>00:09:39</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, yeah?
-I was thinking you could maybe confess...
</p><timestamp>00:09:41</timestamp>

<p>-<subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
-Whoa, hey!
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>-BoJack, shut up and get in here.
-Okay, look at that! Found an emotion.
</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna tell you
something very personal.
</p><timestamp>00:09:49</timestamp>
<p>When I was a little girl, my mom took me
to see <i>A Kernel of Truth</i> on Broadway.
</p><timestamp>00:09:53</timestamp>
<p>It wasn't a big hit.
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I know. I Googled the reviews
so I could mock you.
</p><timestamp>00:09:57</timestamp>
<p>That Frank Rich could be
a real frank bitch, am I right?
</p><timestamp>00:09:59</timestamp>
<p>Well, I was six and it blew my mind.
</p><timestamp>00:10:01</timestamp>
<p>I spent my childhood dreaming of, one day,
getting to sing on Broadway.
</p><timestamp>00:10:04</timestamp>
<p>But, I guess, I wasn't good enough.
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>
<p>So now I get steady TV work,
which is fine, and I'm fine,
but I still listen to that musical
because it reminds me of a time
when I was less jaded,
when I believed I could do anything,
and that makes me feel good.
</p><timestamp>00:10:19</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God, Gina.
</p><timestamp>00:10:20</timestamp>
<p>I-I didn't realize how much
this musical meant to you.
</p><timestamp>00:10:23</timestamp>
<p>-And that... that's even funnier!
-Oh!

<p>I'm sorry you have to deal with all this.
</p><timestamp>00:11:20</timestamp>
<p>Is it just me
or was your sister flirting with me?
</p><timestamp>00:11:23</timestamp>
<p>Ugh, when we were in high school,
</p><timestamp>00:11:25</timestamp>
<p>I was still trying to figure out
my sexuality,
so, I dressed as Mindy,
and tried to seduce her boyfriend.
</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>-Hmm.
-I quickly realized I wasn't into it,
but Mindy found out,
and now that I have a boyfriend,
she probably wants to have sex with you
to get revenge. Typical sister stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:11:40</timestamp>
<p>I thought sisters were doing it
for themselves.
</p><timestamp>00:11:42</timestamp>
<p>I mean, what does she need me for?
</p><timestamp>00:11:44</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>knocking</subtitle>

can you help me move some furniture?
My husband has a hernia.
</p><timestamp>00:11:48</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, no, I noticed in the marzipan.
</p><timestamp>00:11:51</timestamp>
<p>So, what, uh,
furniture do you want me to--
</p><timestamp>00:11:53</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
-Oh, no! Your garment fell.
</p><timestamp>00:11:55</timestamp>
<p>This must be so embarrassing for you.
</p><timestamp>00:11:57</timestamp>
<p>Just as I suspected.
You're not sexual at all.
</p><timestamp>00:11:59</timestamp>
<p>Like, heck I'm not.

<p>Okay, quick update.
</p><timestamp>00:12:28</timestamp>
<p>Mindy wants to meet me
for backyard sex at midnight,
and your mother knows I'm asexual.
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p>She showed me her boobs.
</p><timestamp>00:12:34</timestamp>
<p>Please tell me you said, "Ahh-ooga!"
</p><timestamp>00:12:36</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I didn't!
</p><timestamp>00:12:37</timestamp>
<p>Oh, no! She'll disown me!
We gotta convince her you're super horny.
</p><timestamp>00:12:41</timestamp>
<p>-How?
-If Mindy told my mom
that you made a pass at her,
that would prove you're not asexual.
</p><timestamp>00:12:46</timestamp>
<p>Here's the plan.
We'll wait until the cock crows midnight.
</p><timestamp>00:12:49</timestamp>
<p>Who is this cock?
</p><timestamp>00:12:50</timestamp>
<p>When she's at the backyard,
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>I'll sneak in her room
and wear her clothes.
</p><timestamp>00:12:53</timestamp>
<p>I'll pretend I'm Mindy
and tell my mother you made a pass at me.
</p><timestamp>00:12:55</timestamp>
<p>Okay, this sounds a little complicated,
but I think I can handle
exactly this amount of complication
as long as things don't become
one bit more complicated.

-Hey, I'm sorry I made fun of your dream.
</p><timestamp>00:13:10</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> It's okay.
Just don't tell anyone about it.
</p><timestamp>00:13:13</timestamp>
<p>Good news; too late.
I talked to Flip and Princess Carolyn
about how you're
into this Broadway crap...
</p><timestamp>00:13:17</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-...and they said maybe you can sing
in the nightclub episode.
Can you believe it?
</p><timestamp>00:13:21</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, my God.
-It's your big break, and I helped!
</p><timestamp>00:13:23</timestamp>
<p>I don't want help.
Why would you do that?
</p><timestamp>00:13:25</timestamp>
<p>I know you don't want me
doing nice things
because I'm not your boyfriend,
and you're a sentient wall of spikes,
but they want to hear you sing
at the next break.
</p><timestamp>00:13:33</timestamp>
<p>Here's a song!
</p><timestamp>00:13:34</timestamp>
<p><music> Hell, no!</music>
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>Gina, this is your dream,
and there's nothing more precious
than dreams.
</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>It doesn't work that way.
</p><timestamp>00:13:40</timestamp>
<p>You're used to being the star,
so good things always happen to you.
</p><timestamp>00:13:43</timestamp>
<p>I'm not the star.
</p><timestamp>00:13:44</timestamp>
<p>I'm the third on the call sheet
for <i>Murder Hospital,</i>
or <i>Who Called the Monkey Paramedics.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:13:48</timestamp>
<p>And maybe if I'm lucky, when I'm 60,
</p><timestamp>00:13:50</timestamp>
<p>I can get a<i> </i>juicy season arc
on the right cable show
where everyone goes,
"Who's this 60-year-old woman?
</p><timestamp>00:13:55</timestamp>
<p>She came out of nowhere."
Then I win an Emmy in a movie
where I play Benjamin Bratt's mother.
</p><timestamp>00:13:59</timestamp>
<p>Gina, I know, but what I'm saying is,
what if you are the star?
</p><timestamp>00:14:02</timestamp>
<p>-I'm not.
-But what if you are?
</p><timestamp>00:14:04</timestamp>
<p>If you don't try, you'll never know.
You'll spend the rest of your life
wondering if you could have made it
or not.
</p><timestamp>00:14:09</timestamp>
<p>Is that what you want?
Always the Bratt's mom and never Da Brat?

</p><timestamp>00:14:44</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'd never tell a date
that I get the <i>New York Times,</i>

<p>Ah! Mrs. Buenaventura!
</p><timestamp>00:15:30</timestamp>
<p>I was trying to understand
how someone could be like you,
so I did a little research.

</p><timestamp>00:15:36</timestamp>

<p>I've grown tired of the whole world
thinking of me as a sex object.
</p><timestamp>00:15:44</timestamp>
<p>For once in my life I would like to have
a close, intimate experience
that has nothing to do with sex.

<p>Hmm.
</p><timestamp>00:16:09</timestamp>
<p>Mom, are you there? It's me, Mindy.
</p><timestamp>00:16:11</timestamp>
<p>You can tell
because I'm dressed like a slut, as usual.
</p><timestamp>00:16:13</timestamp>
<p>Mindy, come down here.
I have a question only you can answer.
</p><timestamp>00:16:18</timestamp>
<p>Oh, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:16:23</timestamp>
<p>If you really want to be asexual,
first, you have to put on
every piece of clothing you own.
</p><timestamp>00:16:28</timestamp>
<p>That's how we make sure
we don't look sexy.
</p><timestamp>00:16:31</timestamp>
<p>So, leave me and go do that.
</p><timestamp>00:16:34</timestamp>
<p>Very well, but I'll be back
to not have sex with you.
</p><timestamp>00:16:37</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, I'm getting less excited
just thinking about it.
</p><timestamp>00:16:40</timestamp>
<p>Hoo-hoo! Hooba, hooba.
</p><timestamp>00:16:43</timestamp>

personal lubricant.
</p><timestamp>00:16:58</timestamp>
<p>As you know, when a Buenaventura
is about to make love
for the first time in our home,
we always give them a barrel
of the family lube.

</p><timestamp>00:20:28</timestamp>
<p>That was just mean, to her and to us.
</p><timestamp>00:20:30</timestamp>
<p>No. I thought she'd be good.
I was trying to do a nice thing.
</p><timestamp>00:20:33</timestamp>
<p>And I would like to be judged solely
on my intentions this time.

You ruined our family heirloom.
</p><timestamp>00:20:43</timestamp>
<p>Ah! I'm sorryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy...
</p><timestamp>00:20:51</timestamp>

-That's for trying to trick Todd
into having sex with you!
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>And that's for having sex
with my boyfriend in high school!
</p><timestamp>00:20:58</timestamp>
<p>I never had sex with him!
</p><timestamp>00:21:00</timestamp>
<p>Yes, you did!
The whole school knew about it.
</p><timestamp>00:21:02</timestamp>
<p>No, I didn't.
</p><timestamp>00:21:03</timestamp>
<p>I was going to, but I ran away
because I'm <subtitle>shouting</subtitle> asexuaaaaaaaaal!
</p><timestamp>00:21:08</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:21:12</timestamp>
<p>You know,
it felt good to finally tell them.
</p><timestamp>00:21:14</timestamp>
<p>I was surprised
how cool they were with it.
</p><timestamp>00:21:16</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, I kind of forgot
that despite our differences,
they're family and they love me.
</p><timestamp>00:21:20</timestamp>
<p>So, I guess all that sneaking around
was completely pointless.
</p><timestamp>00:21:23</timestamp>
<p>Hey, you're right!
What a silly waste of time.
</p><timestamp>00:21:28</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, can I ask you something?
-Of course.
</p><timestamp>00:21:30</timestamp>
<p>Why did you tell your family
I went to college?
</p><timestamp>00:21:33</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I don't know, I guess
I just wanted you to seem impressive.
</p><timestamp>00:21:36</timestamp>
<p>-Impressive to who?
-Todd... <subtitle>sighs</subtitle> To whom.
</p><timestamp>00:21:41</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:21:42</timestamp>
<p>-Yolanda, we need to break up.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:21:45</timestamp>
<p>The only thing we have in common
is that we're asexual.
</p><timestamp>00:21:49</timestamp>
<p>I'm sure there's a guy out there for you,
whom's smart and accomplished
</p><timestamp>00:21:54</timestamp>
<p>-and whom went to college--
-And also doesn't want to have sex?
</p><timestamp>00:21:57</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Probably.
</p><timestamp>00:22:00</timestamp>
<p>-But what if there isn't?
-Well, then let's make a deal.
</p><timestamp>00:22:04</timestamp>
<p>How about if neither of us meet
anybody else by the time we're a hundred,
we give this another shot?
</p><timestamp>00:22:10</timestamp>
<p>When we're a hundred? I don't know.
Are you gonna steal my dentures
and use them to build
some sort of motorized nutcracker,
but then the nutcracker's AI
becomes self-aware
and leads all the other dentures
in the nursing home in a toothy revolt?
</p><timestamp>00:22:21</timestamp>
<p>-I wanna say no, but probably yes.
-<subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:22:25</timestamp>
<p>Well, then, I guess I'll see you
when we're a hundred.

<p>Are you the type of war dramatized
in <i>The Hunt for Red October?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:22:40</timestamp>
<p>Because you're cold.
</p><timestamp>00:22:41</timestamp>
<p>That one doesn't even make sense.
How do you hunt a month?
</p><timestamp>00:22:44</timestamp>
<p>I know that it was really hard
to hear what I said in the restaurant,
but... I want you to know
everything about me,
even the hard stuff.
</p><timestamp>00:22:52</timestamp>
<p>I get it. This is a bad time for you
to start a relationship.
</p><timestamp>00:22:55</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle> Of course it's a bad time!
</p><timestamp>00:22:57</timestamp>
<p>I just signed divorce papers.
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>But I can't control
when I meet someone special.
</p><timestamp>00:23:01</timestamp>
<p>So, what am I supposed to do, just pretend
I don't want to see you every night?
</p><timestamp>00:23:04</timestamp>
<p>But what if I'm like the space station?
</p><timestamp>00:23:06</timestamp>
<p>After a while, you get bored of me
and replace me with someone new.
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>Look, I don't know the future.
</p><timestamp>00:23:11</timestamp>
<p>This could end in heartbreak
for both of us.
</p><timestamp>00:23:13</timestamp>
<p>I mean, most relationships do.
</p><timestamp>00:23:15</timestamp>
<p>And if I'm honest,
it's not usually me that gets bored.
</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>But I'd like to see where it goes
because... I like you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:21</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> And we have fun together.
</p><timestamp>00:23:23</timestamp>
<p>And every time we see each other,
I like you a little more.
</p><timestamp>00:23:26</timestamp>
<p>Hmm. Hey, am I Taylor Swift's grudge
against Katy Perry, right now?
</p><timestamp>00:23:31</timestamp>
<p>Because even though it makes no sense,
I want to be held for a superlong time.

<p><subtitle>stammers</subtitle> Look, I'm sorry.
I thought--

<p>Hey, from now on,
let's just stick to the original rules
</p><timestamp>00:24:02</timestamp>
<p>-and not get in each other's business.
-Yes, of course.
</p><timestamp>00:24:05</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>stammers</subtitle> I'm sorry. I didn't even--
-For the record, you were right.
</p><timestamp>00:24:08</timestamp>
<p>If I didn't sing there,
I would have spent the rest of my life
not knowing
if I ever could have made it or not.
</p><timestamp>00:24:13</timestamp>
<p>Now I know. So, good.

It doesn't mean that everything--
</p><timestamp>00:24:17</timestamp>
<p>I said it's fine.
</p><timestamp>00:24:18</timestamp>
<p>You did your good deed,
so, you can feel good about yourself.
</p><timestamp>00:24:21</timestamp>
<p>-Hmm.
-I'm going to bed.
</p><timestamp>00:24:24</timestamp>
<p>If you want to have sex with me, you can.
Otherwise, I'll see you in the morning.
