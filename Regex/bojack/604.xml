</p><timestamp>00:03:34</timestamp>
<p>You're... <subtitle>sucks teeth</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:36</timestamp>
<p>...too late.
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-What?
-He's... <subtitle>sucks teeth</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}...gone...
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-No!
-...to a party for the night.
</p><timestamp>00:03:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Here's the address.
Sorry for all the wincing.
</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I put too many jalapeños

</p><timestamp>00:03:46</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}A party? With alcohol?
</p><timestamp>00:03:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No, a lame party, without alcohol.
</p><timestamp>00:03:51</timestamp>
<p>Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:03:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Don't worry. We sent him
with a trained sober companion.
</p><timestamp>00:03:55</timestamp>
<p>He'll keep him out of trouble.
</p><timestamp>00:03:59</timestamp>
<p>This is Eduardo.
He's here to keep me out of trouble.
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> Say, aren't you
one of those fainting goats?
</p><timestamp>00:04:04</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle> Only if I panic.
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>So, what makes you panic?
</p><timestamp>00:04:08</timestamp>
<p>Nothing. The whole point is
he doesn't panic. Sober companion.
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You know what makes me panic?
</p><timestamp>00:04:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Most of the time
I'm an ocean-levels-rising guy,
but sometimes I like to dwell
on the fact that
there will always be invisible walls
between myself and those who claim
to know me.
</p><timestamp>00:04:24</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> That sure is nerve-racking,
but the only thing that makes me panic
is the thought
that I might someday drink again.
</p><timestamp>00:04:30</timestamp>
<p>-A toast to that never happening!
-<subtitle>whimpers and thuds</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Very helpful. Thank you, Eduardo.
</p><timestamp>00:04:38</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I'm just Greg, a guy Mr. Peanutbutter 
met at a gas station once.
</p><timestamp>00:04:41</timestamp>
<p>I honestly don't even know
why I got invited to this party.

your time-travelling orthodontist pitch!

<p>Demi, you are lighting a long fuse

<p>{\an8}Could you go tell BoJack to come out
so I can talk to him?
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}What? I don't have time
for your classic Diane wackiness.
</p><timestamp>00:05:11</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We gotta get these to the balloon room!

<p>-<subtitle>groans</subtitle>
-Wow! Baby! Cute!
</p><timestamp>00:05:22</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>giggling</subtitle>
-She's crawling all over the place.
</p><timestamp>00:05:24</timestamp>
<p>I wasn't gonna bring her out,
but another nanny quit on me.
</p><timestamp>00:05:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Carlotta quit, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I assume she resigned in disgrace
</p><timestamp>00:05:30</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}for not making good airplane noises
when she feeds Ruthie?
</p><timestamp>00:05:33</timestamp>
<p>No, she said she felt
she was being watched all day.
</p><timestamp>00:05:37</timestamp>
<p>Impossible! I'm there around the clock,
observing her every move.
</p><timestamp>00:05:41</timestamp>
<p>-If she was being watched, I'd know!
-Uh-huh.
</p><timestamp>00:05:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Uh, where do these balloons go?
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>Hello, Pickles' best friend Ilana.
</p><timestamp>00:05:52</timestamp>
<p>Pickles' other friend Ilana.
Didn't think I'd see you here.
</p><timestamp>00:05:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And then of course, there's always
the looming fear
my spleen could up and re-twist itself.
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}How are we back in a conversation?
</p><timestamp>00:06:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}It's like I'm trying to canoe out to sea,
but the current keeps washing me back
to the same shallow backwater.
</p><timestamp>00:06:08</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, there you are.
-Thank God, I'm so glad you're here.
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>-Never leave my side.
-I have to tell you--
</p><timestamp>00:06:12</timestamp>
<p>-Okay, everybody get to your places!
-What's happening?
</p><timestamp>00:06:16</timestamp>
<p>Mr. Peanutbutter's and Pickles'
surprise wedding!
</p><timestamp>00:06:20</timestamp>
<p>Surprise wedding?
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>The wedding planning
was stressing Mr. Peanutbutter out,
and Pickles loves big romantic surprises.
</p><timestamp>00:06:27</timestamp>
<p>And I'm not doing much
except for sitting at home
watching Princess Carolyn's
terrible nannies,
so naturally, I thought,
"Ooh! Surprise wedding!"
</p><timestamp>00:06:35</timestamp>
<p>-Where are they now?
-I got them two tickets
to <i>Angels in the Outfield.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:40</timestamp>
<p>-The movie?
-The play. It's like six hours long.
</p><timestamp>00:06:43</timestamp>
<p>Do you mean <i>Angels in America?</i>
</p><timestamp>00:06:45</timestamp>
<p>Whatever it is,
after that feel-good comedy,
they'll be in a great mood for a wedding!
</p><timestamp>00:06:51</timestamp>
<p>Wow. Okay...
</p><timestamp>00:06:54</timestamp>
<p>Look, I cannot be here.
Just... I'm moving.
</p><timestamp>00:06:56</timestamp>
<p>Great, your apartment's a dump.
Where are you moving to?
</p><timestamp>00:06:58</timestamp>
<p>Uh, not Echo Park. I'll never see you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:01</timestamp>
<p>-Chicago.
-Chicago? <i>Chicago</i> Chicago?
</p><timestamp>00:07:03</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, they just pulled into the driveway!
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p>-Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

</p><timestamp>00:07:08</timestamp>
<p>Everybody hide and stay quiet.

<p>Remember, as soon as the lights go on,
just jump up and yell, "Surprise!"

<p>-Lights, off!
-<subtitle>lights beep</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:23</timestamp>
<p>Um, Pickles? Would you mind
turning off the livestream?
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>There's something I need
to discuss with you. Privately.
</p><timestamp>00:07:29</timestamp>
<p>Ooh, I hope it's something good!
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>It's not.

<p>Before Robot House assaults us
with the harsh, unforgiving glare
of our energy-efficient bulbs,
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p>I need to tell you this.
</p><timestamp>00:07:42</timestamp>
<p>But it's so dark in here.
</p><timestamp>00:07:44</timestamp>
<p>What I'm about to confess is so shameful,
</p><timestamp>00:07:46</timestamp>
<p>I can only admit it
in the cover of shadow.
</p><timestamp>00:07:48</timestamp>
<p>Don't be silly. Lights, on!
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>

<p>-<subtitle>voice breaking</subtitle> You cheated on me?
-I am so sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:07:58</timestamp>
<p>-How could you do this?
-It was the worst mistake of my life!
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>And I once played Twister
with Bryan Singer
at Kevin Spacey's party
for Andy Dick's early parole.
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>-Ugh!
-I've been in the Thunder Room every night
for months trying to swallow my shame.
</p><timestamp>00:08:12</timestamp>
<p>But I can't. And I've apparently been
so racked with guilt I left the door open.
</p><timestamp>00:08:15</timestamp>

<p>Are you the time I went to see
Lady Gaga in concert
and she didn't sing "Paparazzi"?
</p><timestamp>00:08:29</timestamp>
<p>Because I am hurt,
and I am confused, and I am angry,
and nobody told me there was going to be
an encore, so I just went home and...
</p><timestamp>00:08:35</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>groans</subtitle>
-Why am I even talking to you?
</p><timestamp>00:08:37</timestamp>
<p>-I need my best friend. I'm calling Ilana!
-<subtitle>gasps</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:08:42</timestamp>
<p>But, honestly,
can Ilana even relate to me anymore?
</p><timestamp>00:08:45</timestamp>
<p>Since she got that
new Sunday-to-Thursday job
she's turned into a real
see-you-next-Friday.
</p><timestamp>00:08:51</timestamp>
<p>I never thought I'd say this,
but sometimes I feel like I prefer
my other friend Ilana.
</p><timestamp>00:08:57</timestamp>
<p>Sometimes it's just easier to talk
to a person who has nothing else going on.
</p><timestamp>00:09:00</timestamp>
<p>-What?
-Please don't tell the Ilanas about this.
</p><timestamp>00:09:02</timestamp>
<p>I'm gonna tell everybody about this.
I'm a Gemini.
</p><timestamp>00:09:06</timestamp>
<p>No! Think of my family!
They need me to be strong right now.
</p><timestamp>00:09:10</timestamp>
<p>Poor Captain Peanutbutter.
</p><timestamp>00:09:11</timestamp>
<p>He recently confided to me
he feels trapped in a loveless marriage
with Mrs. Captain Peanutbutter.

<p>-<subtitle>laughs awkwardly</subtitle>
-Well, can you blame her?
</p><timestamp>00:09:19</timestamp>
<p>Excuse me?
</p><timestamp>00:09:20</timestamp>
<p>Every time I get trapped
in a conversation with Captain,
</p><timestamp>00:09:22</timestamp>
<p>I think, "If I was married to this guy,
</p><timestamp>00:09:25</timestamp>
<p>I would gnaw my own hand off
just to get the ring off my body."
</p><timestamp>00:09:28</timestamp>
<p>At least no one in my family
has anger issues.
</p><timestamp>00:09:30</timestamp>
<p>My father has come so far
with his anger management classes!
</p><timestamp>00:09:34</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry, but your father is a hothead
with a little-pug complex.

</p><timestamp>00:09:48</timestamp>
<p>And the way your mother provokes him!
I think they get off on it,
and they're making us unwilling
participants in their kinky foreplay.
</p><timestamp>00:09:55</timestamp>
<p>Ew! Those are my parents!
</p><timestamp>00:09:57</timestamp>
<p>-And don't even get me started on Greg.
-<subtitle>shushes</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:00</timestamp>
<p>That guy that I met once
at that gas station!
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>-Why are you bringing him up?
-I don't know, but he sucks, too!
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>
<p>-Oh.
-There, I got it off my chest.
</p><timestamp>00:10:09</timestamp>
<p>I know who I need right now.
</p><timestamp>00:10:11</timestamp>
<p>No, Pickles. Please don't TweedFeed this.
</p><timestamp>00:10:13</timestamp>
<p>I understand your Pickle Pack
is part of how you process pain.
</p><timestamp>00:10:15</timestamp>
<p>Wrong, Mr. Mister.
The Pack isn't part of anything.
</p><timestamp>00:10:19</timestamp>
<p>They are everything.
</p><timestamp>00:10:20</timestamp>
<p>When I stabbed myself in the eye
with a boba straw,
they all sent me photos
of themselves wearing eyepatches.
</p><timestamp>00:10:27</timestamp>

stickyvicki was the first person
to say, "LMAO. Sorry for your loss."

</p><timestamp>00:21:57</timestamp>
<p>Because if something happens,
and I'm in Chicago--
</p><timestamp>00:21:59</timestamp>
<p>That's not a friendship,
that's a hostage situation.
</p><timestamp>00:22:03</timestamp>
<p>Go to Chicago. I'll be fine.
</p><timestamp>00:22:06</timestamp>
<p>Thank you.

<p>Let's get you away
from these delightful choking hazards!
</p><timestamp>00:22:28</timestamp>
<p>You know, Todd, you have a knack for this.
</p><timestamp>00:22:30</timestamp>
<p>Would you wanna be her nanny?
</p><timestamp>00:22:32</timestamp>
<p>I do know her routine
and all of her favorite foods
and how to do funny voices
for bedtime stories,
unlike Carlotta who does voices
like Cameron Diaz

</p><timestamp>00:22:54</timestamp>
<p>I don't want to be mad at you.
</p><timestamp>00:22:58</timestamp>
<p>It sucks that I have to be mad at you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:00</timestamp>
<p>This should be
the happiest time of my life,
but now because you did something stupid,
I have to feel bad.
</p><timestamp>00:23:08</timestamp>
<p>That's not fair.
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>And I still love you and...
<subtitle>sighs</subtitle> I still wanna marry you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:15</timestamp>
<p>But you can't do things
that hurt me like that.
</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>It's not okay.
</p><timestamp>00:23:20</timestamp>
<p>And if we just go back
to the way things were before
and pretend nothing happened,
I'm gonna feel stupid.
</p><timestamp>00:23:27</timestamp>
<p>We can't just go back.
</p><timestamp>00:23:29</timestamp>
<p>How can we make this right?
</p><timestamp>00:23:32</timestamp>
<p>Don't just stand there!
I'm talking to you.
</p><timestamp>00:23:34</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry. I want us to stay together.
I want you to trust me.
</p><timestamp>00:23:39</timestamp>
<p>I wanna make us even somehow.
</p><timestamp>00:23:42</timestamp>
<p>Even? The only logical way to be even
would be if I got to sleep
with somebody else.
</p><timestamp>00:23:47</timestamp>
<p>Okay. If that's what needs to happen.
</p><timestamp>00:23:49</timestamp>
<p>-Really?
-Yeah, we just have to think who--
</p><timestamp>00:23:51</timestamp>
<p>Buzzy. My high school boyfriend, Buzzy.
</p><timestamp>00:23:53</timestamp>
<p>Very quick with that name, but okay. Fine.
</p><timestamp>00:23:55</timestamp>
<p>No, you don't even know him.
</p><timestamp>00:23:56</timestamp>
<p>Knowing is what hurts the most.
</p><timestamp>00:23:58</timestamp>
<p>What if I sleep with Buzzy <i>and </i>Tyler
from Soul Cycle?
</p><timestamp>00:24:02</timestamp>
<p>-Two people?
-Well, maybe we can keep brainstorming.
</p><timestamp>00:24:06</timestamp>
<p>If we put our heads together,
</p><timestamp>00:24:07</timestamp>
<p>I know we'll find the perfect guy
for you to cheat on me with
that makes it totally even,
so things can go back to normal
and we can get married.
</p><timestamp>00:24:15</timestamp>
<p>-Thank you.

<p>-Hey, guys.
-Diane?
</p><timestamp>00:24:21</timestamp>
<p>I'm just here to randomly apologize
for that time we cheated on Pickles twice.
</p><timestamp>00:24:24</timestamp>
<p>It was a big mistake, and it was my fault,
and it will never happen again.
</p><timestamp>00:24:28</timestamp>
<p>Also, I think I left my wallet here
when I came to your party
a year and a half ago.
</p><timestamp>00:24:32</timestamp>
<p>If you find it, probably under the bed
in the master suite,
could you mail it to me?
I live in Chicago now. Thanks.
</p><timestamp>00:24:37</timestamp>
<p>This is Eduardo. Don't mind him.
He's just keeping me sober.
</p><timestamp>00:24:40</timestamp>
<p>Found the baby, had a blast, gotta go.
</p><timestamp>00:24:42</timestamp>
<p>-And here's your boba.
-Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:24:46</timestamp>
<p>-Odd.
