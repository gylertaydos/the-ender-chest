</p><timestamp>00:00:17</timestamp>
<p>What you got there?
</p><timestamp>00:00:18</timestamp>
<p>I think it's a hydrangea.
</p><timestamp>00:00:20</timestamp>
<p>Does she even like that kind of plant?
</p><timestamp>00:00:22</timestamp>
<p>Probably not. She doesn't like anything.
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p>Hello, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p>Thanks for having me, Mom.
</p><timestamp>00:00:28</timestamp>
<p>You're the guest of honor.
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>Everyone, BoJack is here.
</p><timestamp>00:00:32</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Herb</subtitle> Hey, buddy! Get in here!
-<subtitle>Sarah Lynn giggles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>-For you.
-Oh, a plant.
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>-Dirt for inside. Goody.

</p><timestamp>00:01:40</timestamp>
<p>You got here just in time, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:01:41</timestamp>
<p>A bird flew in through the window
and we're having trouble
getting her out of the house.
</p><timestamp>00:01:45</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Sarah Lynn</subtitle> Yeah, call yourself early
and go get a worm!
</p><timestamp>00:01:48</timestamp>
<p>Golly, she's more coy
than a coyote claiming a cottontail.
</p><timestamp>00:01:51</timestamp>
<p>-Ahem. Phone for you, Mrs. Horseman.
-<subtitle>grunting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:01:53</timestamp>
<p>Thank you, butler.
</p><timestamp>00:01:54</timestamp>
<p>-Is that Zach Braff?
-Who?
</p><timestamp>00:01:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Zach Braff. Actor, independent filmmaker,
real-life friend of Donald Faison?
</p><timestamp>00:02:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-You mean my butler?
-At your service!
</p><timestamp>00:02:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I actually was friends with Donald
in real life.
</p><timestamp>00:02:05</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}He's a spectacular man--
</p><timestamp>00:02:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Butler!
-Sorry! Phone call for you.
</p><timestamp>00:02:08</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}I'll take it in the kitchen.
</p><timestamp>00:02:10</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}BoJack, make yourself useful for a change
and help, will ya?
</p><timestamp>00:02:13</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}With the bird?
</p><timestamp>00:02:16</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hello? Oh, it's you.
</p><timestamp>00:02:18</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}All right. That does it! <subtitle>grunts</subtitle>
Son of a--!
</p><timestamp>00:02:21</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}With a drop like that,
</p><timestamp>00:02:23</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}you'd think she was the ratings
for <i>Veronica's Closet</i>
</p><timestamp>00:02:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}when it moved to Mondays.
</p><timestamp>00:02:26</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Ugh. Comedy poison.
Who wants to laugh on a Monday?
</p><timestamp>00:02:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}BJ! Finally made it
to our little soirée, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:02:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yeah, I kept having this dream
where I was having dinner
</p><timestamp>00:02:35</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}with all the people who were gone
and I thought, "I should do that!"
</p><timestamp>00:02:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So, here I am.
</p><timestamp>00:02:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-We've got to flank her from the left.
-<subtitle>bird</subtitle> Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:02:43</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hello. Crackerjack?
</p><timestamp>00:02:45</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-That's what it says on my underpants!
-<subtitle>giggles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:02:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>grunts</subtitle> The uncle I never met
and yet could never live up to!
</p><timestamp>00:02:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>grunts</subtitle> All right, soldier. Ready, aim...
</p><timestamp>00:02:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-<subtitle>bird giggles</subtitle>
-Huh?
</p><timestamp>00:02:56</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hey! What's up, man?
</p><timestamp>00:02:58</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hey, Corduroy. <subtitle>stammers</subtitle> Good to...
</p><timestamp>00:03:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Still weirded out because the last time
you saw me I was naked,
</p><timestamp>00:03:03</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}hanging from my iPhone charger,
holding a lemon, with a very erect penis
</p><timestamp>00:03:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}despite being deceased in my trailer
for over an hour?
</p><timestamp>00:03:09</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yep.
</p><timestamp>00:03:10</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You're gonna have to get over that, buddy.
</p><timestamp>00:03:12</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Hmm. Mm. Ooh.
</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-What are you...? Stop that.
-Oh! Oh, sorry.
</p><timestamp>00:03:17</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Forgot where I was for a second.
</p><timestamp>00:03:19</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Think this'll help?
-Kid's got the right idea.
</p><timestamp>00:03:21</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We can chuck the choker
and spook her with this poker!
</p><timestamp>00:03:25</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Show her who's boss!
-<subtitle>Sarah Lynn</subtitle> Ruffle her feathers!
</p><timestamp>00:03:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>Corduroy</subtitle> Get her to the kitchen!
</p><timestamp>00:03:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}<subtitle>grunting</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:30</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}And that!
</p><timestamp>00:03:32</timestamp>
<p>-All right!
-<subtitle>Herb</subtitle> Go!
</p><timestamp>00:03:33</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Crackerjack</subtitle> Ha-cha!
</p><timestamp>00:03:37</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Sarah Lynn cheers</subtitle>
-<subtitle>all whooping</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:39</timestamp>
<p>Yes, yes, BoJack bullied a bird.
Bully for him.
</p><timestamp>00:03:43</timestamp>
<p>Speaking of useless,
my husband is running late,
so we're gonna start dinner without him.
</p><timestamp>00:03:47</timestamp>
<p>He'll be here before the show starts,
won't he?
</p><timestamp>00:03:49</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}He'd better be.
</p><timestamp>00:03:50</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}In the meantime,
let's adjourn to the dining room
</p><timestamp>00:03:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}before our dinners get
as cold as my parenting style.
</p><timestamp>00:03:57</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>all laughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:03:58</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Sarah Lynn</subtitle> I think mine would be
the first time someone asked
for my autograph.
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p>-Really?
-Oh, wow!
</p><timestamp>00:04:04</timestamp>
<p>I didn't even know how to write my name!
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p>I just drew a squiggle!
</p><timestamp>00:04:07</timestamp>
<p>-Water?
-Thank you, Zach Braff.
</p><timestamp>00:04:08</timestamp>
<p>You only get to give
your first autograph once, you know.
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>The second time it becomes an obligation,
the third time a chore.
</p><timestamp>00:04:15</timestamp>
<p>But the first time...
<subtitle>sighs] The first time... [chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:18</timestamp>
<p>-Hey. What is that?
-Ah, ah, ah.
</p><timestamp>00:04:21</timestamp>
<p>Shh.
</p><timestamp>00:04:24</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> Mm.
-Okay. My turn.
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>Mine was also when I signed
on a dotted line to enlist.
</p><timestamp>00:04:29</timestamp>
<p>Are you ready to sing "The Lollypop Song"
in the big show later?
</p><timestamp>00:04:33</timestamp>
<p>No, Mom.
You know I never make it to the show.
</p><timestamp>00:04:35</timestamp>
<p>I didn't know then that enlisting
would lead to my two worst parts.
</p><timestamp>00:04:38</timestamp>
<p>You have two?
I didn't know we could pick two.
</p><timestamp>00:04:40</timestamp>
<p>Corduroy, it's a conversation,
not an assignment.
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Corduroy</subtitle> In that case, I have three.
-<subtitle>Herb</subtitle> Three is way too many.
</p><timestamp>00:04:45</timestamp>
<p>My worst parts were saying goodbye
to my mother
and seeing a bullet go straight
through my general's face,
right before it hit my own.
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>all gasp</subtitle>
-At least your death was instantaneous.
</p><timestamp>00:04:54</timestamp>
<p>I can still hear the loud drips of my IV
from when I had cancer.
</p><timestamp>00:04:58</timestamp>
<p>-Drip. Drip.
-Ooh.
</p><timestamp>00:05:00</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Corduroy</subtitle> What about you, BoJack?
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:05:02</timestamp>
<p>Best part, worst part, what about you?
</p><timestamp>00:05:04</timestamp>
<p>Well, I guess my worst part
has to be, um...
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p>Right before I got here, I think? Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:05:11</timestamp>
<p>I went to Angela Diaz's house.
</p><timestamp>00:05:14</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>gulps, spits</subtitle> Ugh!
</p><timestamp>00:05:16</timestamp>
<p>Does anyone else's water
taste like chlorine?
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Braff, can I get
some different water over here?
</p><timestamp>00:05:20</timestamp>
<p>Right away, Mr. Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>
<p>Crackerjack, do you think your death
meant something
because it was in the service
of a greater cause?
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p>-Aw, shucks.
-Of course it meant something.
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>I think questions like that are too big
for a little soldier like me.
</p><timestamp>00:05:31</timestamp>
<p>My brother gave the ultimate sacrifice.
</p><timestamp>00:05:33</timestamp>
<p>-Because sometimes I wonder--
-But see, this is where I get hung up,
because when we valorize
the idea of sacrifice,
</p><timestamp>00:05:39</timestamp>
<p>-of loss, of suffering--
-BoJack, don't start with this again.
</p><timestamp>00:05:41</timestamp>
<p>When we grow up
in a house that does that,
we internalize this idea
that being happy is a selfish act,
but sacrifice doesn't mean anything.
</p><timestamp>00:05:50</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Sarah Lynn</subtitle> Yes, it does.
-Sacrifice?
</p><timestamp>00:05:51</timestamp>
<p>In the service of something greater,
maybe, but just in and of itself?
</p><timestamp>00:05:55</timestamp>
<p>-What's the good in that?
-A lot.
</p><timestamp>00:05:56</timestamp>
<p>Sacrifice is good.
</p><timestamp>00:05:58</timestamp>
<p>It has to be because I sacrificed a ton,
and I was freaking awesome.
</p><timestamp>00:06:02</timestamp>
<p>Oh, and what did you ever sacrifice?
</p><timestamp>00:06:04</timestamp>
<p>I gave everything.
</p><timestamp>00:06:06</timestamp>
<p>I gave my whole life.
</p><timestamp>00:06:07</timestamp>
<p>You died in a hedonistic bender.
</p><timestamp>00:06:09</timestamp>
<p>I'm not talking about my death.
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>I'm talking about my life.
I gave my whole life.
</p><timestamp>00:06:15</timestamp>
<p>If we get into everyone's whole life,
we're gonna be here all night.
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>It's called "Best Part/Worst Part,"
not "Everything That Ever Happened."
</p><timestamp>00:06:21</timestamp>
<p>Okay, worst part:
the 2007 "Sexually Confident Virgin Tour."
</p><timestamp>00:06:26</timestamp>
<p>My manager leaked nudes
to get more tour dates added,
my mom pointed out every carb I ate,
it was hell.
</p><timestamp>00:06:33</timestamp>
<p>But it gave millions of fans
a show they will never forget.
</p><timestamp>00:06:37</timestamp>
<p>And that is worth something.
</p><timestamp>00:06:39</timestamp>
<p>No, that's a high you chase.
</p><timestamp>00:06:40</timestamp>
<p>-It was not.
-You think you singing songs on stage
is the same thing as this guy
who died liberating the camps?
</p><timestamp>00:06:45</timestamp>
<p>We don't need to compare
apples to Auschwitzes.
</p><timestamp>00:06:48</timestamp>
<p>Herb, tell 'em. It means something--
the work we do, the joy we bring.
</p><timestamp>00:06:52</timestamp>
<p>It has to, right?
</p><timestamp>00:06:54</timestamp>
<p>Boy, I sure thought so.
I-I used to really believe in it.
</p><timestamp>00:06:57</timestamp>
<p>I mean, I was one "trapped in an airport
during a snowstorm
on the eve of the dance championship
guest starring Gregory Hines" episode
away from an Emmy.
</p><timestamp>00:07:05</timestamp>
<p>Then I lost it all.
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>Ow! Seriously, is no one noticing
this leak?
</p><timestamp>00:07:09</timestamp>
<p>Fine, we'll get a bucket.
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p>-The drips are hitting me!
-Then you'll hold the bucket.
</p><timestamp>00:07:12</timestamp>
<p>But the funny thing is,
it wasn't until I got fired
that I actually became myself.
</p><timestamp>00:07:17</timestamp>
<p>I was out of the closet. I was free.
I was authentically me.
</p><timestamp>00:07:21</timestamp>
<p>What does being authentic
have to do with anything?
</p><timestamp>00:07:24</timestamp>
<p>Well, when I wasn't hiding
behind some facade, I could be at peace.
</p><timestamp>00:07:27</timestamp>
<p>That's when I really got
into philanthropy.
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>-Can I ask you something, Herb?
-Why do people say that?
</p><timestamp>00:07:32</timestamp>
<p>If you're asking it, then yes,
you can and you will and you just did.
</p><timestamp>00:07:36</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, why are we announcing our questions?
</p><timestamp>00:07:38</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, what are these questions, royalty?
-<subtitle>imitates fanfare</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:42</timestamp>
<p>Announcing King and Queen Query
of the Interrogative Isle.
</p><timestamp>00:07:45</timestamp>
<p>May I ask you how do you do?
</p><timestamp>00:07:47</timestamp>
<p>-Very well, thanks.
-Ah, bup, bup, bup!
</p><timestamp>00:07:50</timestamp>
<p>I didn't ask you yet.
I asked if I could ask you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:54</timestamp>
<p>Did you get pleasure
from your charity work?
</p><timestamp>00:07:56</timestamp>
<p>Like real, deep pleasure?
</p><timestamp>00:07:57</timestamp>
<p>It dwarfed every other joy in my life.
</p><timestamp>00:07:59</timestamp>
<p>Doesn't count then.
If you got pleasure, it wasn't selfless.
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>And it's only good if it's selfless.
</p><timestamp>00:08:04</timestamp>
<p>Who made up that rule? I helped people.
</p><timestamp>00:08:06</timestamp>
<p>Who cares if it made me feel good, too?
</p><timestamp>00:08:09</timestamp>
<p>Feeling good is inherently selfish.
</p><timestamp>00:08:11</timestamp>
<p>If I'd given myself to Christ,
truly went down the path--
</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>
<p>I don't care for this talk of religion
in my house.
</p><timestamp>00:08:18</timestamp>
<p>If I wasn't constantly
trying to feel good, get it better,
always looking for maximum pleasure...
<subtitle>sighs</subtitle> That was my worst part.
</p><timestamp>00:08:25</timestamp>
<p>Well, one of the three worst parts.
Wait, actually, can I have four?
</p><timestamp>00:08:28</timestamp>
<p>Discovering you in your trailer
definitely cracks my top five.
</p><timestamp>00:08:31</timestamp>
<p>This is bullshit!
</p><timestamp>00:08:32</timestamp>
<p>I did a lot for a lot of people!
I was not a bad person.
</p><timestamp>00:08:36</timestamp>
<p>No one is accusing you
of being a bad person, Sarah Lynn.
</p><timestamp>00:08:39</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>yelling</subtitle> You are! You all are
with your "being authentic"
and "charity work" and "killing Nazis."
</p><timestamp>00:08:45</timestamp>
<p>I actually never killed a Nazi.
All my kills were friendly fire.
</p><timestamp>00:08:48</timestamp>
<p>I also never liberated any camps.
I'm honestly not sure what I did.
</p><timestamp>00:08:52</timestamp>
<p>Here you go.
Your husband just pulled up, ma'am.
</p><timestamp>00:08:54</timestamp>
<p>Wait, Dad's here?
He's never made it to dinner before.
</p><timestamp>00:08:57</timestamp>
<p>-Hey, here's a question.
-Another question has arrived!
</p><timestamp>00:09:01</timestamp>
<p>Did any of you have a song of yours
played in outer space?
</p><timestamp>00:09:05</timestamp>
<p>Anyone? No. Just me? Oh.
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>That's what I thought.
</p><timestamp>00:09:08</timestamp>
<p>My hit single "No, No, No (No Means Yes)"
is making its way to Mars!
</p><timestamp>00:09:13</timestamp>
<p>That means something.
I will be remembered.
</p><timestamp>00:09:15</timestamp>
<p>-That has to mean something. I will be--
-<subtitle>door opens</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:09:18</timestamp>
<p>Sorry I'm late. Did I miss the show?
</p><timestamp>00:09:20</timestamp>
<p>-Hey!
-There he is! There's our guy!
</p><timestamp>00:09:21</timestamp>
<p>-Dad!
-I...
</p><timestamp>00:09:22</timestamp>
<p>Oh, you didn't miss a thing.
It's not like we have anywhere to be.
</p><timestamp>00:09:25</timestamp>
<p>Why shouldn't we all bend ourselves
to your schedule?
</p><timestamp>00:09:28</timestamp>
<p>I already apologized. I was running.
</p><timestamp>00:09:30</timestamp>
<p>Yes. As always, running late,
while I was running myself ragged
trying to get dinner on the table.
</p><timestamp>00:09:36</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>clears throat</subtitle>
-Yes, you helped.
</p><timestamp>00:09:38</timestamp>
<p>And now I'm running out of patience
for you running your mouth.
</p><timestamp>00:09:41</timestamp>
<p>And I'm running out the clock
until we both...
</p><timestamp>00:09:44</timestamp>
<p>Well. Here we are.
</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p>I'll just squeeze in here.
</p><timestamp>00:09:50</timestamp>
<p>-Get yourself something nice.
-Ooh! Thank you, Mr. Secretariat.
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>-What'd I miss?
-We're playing Best Part/Worst Part.
</p><timestamp>00:09:56</timestamp>
<p>Ooh! I got one! Machu Picchu.
</p><timestamp>00:09:58</timestamp>
<p>When I left "Horsin' Around,"
I honestly thought about killing myself.
</p><timestamp>00:10:02</timestamp>
<p>Shit, Herb. Really?
</p><timestamp>00:10:04</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. But the Knicks
were having a good season
and I wanted to see what happened.
</p><timestamp>00:10:08</timestamp>
<p>Wait, you didn't kill yourself
because the Knicks
were having a good season?
</p><timestamp>00:10:11</timestamp>
<p>What would you have done
if they were having a bad season?
</p><timestamp>00:10:14</timestamp>
<p>I don't know. Gotten into baseball?
</p><timestamp>00:10:15</timestamp>
<p>Oh, for the love...
Where's your follow-through?
</p><timestamp>00:10:18</timestamp>
<p>It's like you didn't even
wanna kill yourself!
</p><timestamp>00:10:20</timestamp>
<p>And I'm so glad I didn't.
</p><timestamp>00:10:21</timestamp>
<p>Because there I was ten years later
at Machu Picchu
and I realized there was so much more
I could do in a life.
</p><timestamp>00:10:30</timestamp>
<p>Okay, my turn.
</p><timestamp>00:10:31</timestamp>
<p>August 22nd, 1973,
I was banned from running ever again.
</p><timestamp>00:10:36</timestamp>
<p>And running, well, that was the only thing
that ever made sense to me,
</p><timestamp>00:10:38</timestamp>
<p>-so if I couldn't do that I was nobody.
-<subtitle>coughing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:42</timestamp>
<p>-This is your worst part?
-Best part: jumping off that bridge.
</p><timestamp>00:10:44</timestamp>
<p>-Jesus.
-What did I say about the Jesus talk?
</p><timestamp>00:10:47</timestamp>
<p>It was my choice.
I got to go on my own terms.
</p><timestamp>00:10:50</timestamp>
<p>Not a lot of people can say that.
</p><timestamp>00:10:51</timestamp>
<p>-No.
-That's true.
</p><timestamp>00:10:52</timestamp>
<p>The view from up there.
</p><timestamp>00:10:54</timestamp>
<p>-Eh, you wouldn't believe it.
-<subtitle>coughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:10:57</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>all laughing</subtitle>
-Oh, my.
</p><timestamp>00:11:01</timestamp>
<p>-It must've been from swimming earlier.
-Oh, you were swimming?
</p><timestamp>00:11:04</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. I, um... <subtitle>clears throat</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>-When was I swimming?
-Don't think about that.
</p><timestamp>00:11:08</timestamp>
<p>-Do you have a best part?
-Oh, uh, I don't know.
</p><timestamp>00:11:10</timestamp>
<p>This past year I took a teaching job.
</p><timestamp>00:11:12</timestamp>
<p>And I had this one student
who was really struggling,
just couldn't get over this hump.
</p><timestamp>00:11:16</timestamp>
<p>And what, you helped him
do good in a scene? For your class?
</p><timestamp>00:11:20</timestamp>
<p>That's the best part of your whole life?
</p><timestamp>00:11:22</timestamp>
<p>I don't know, I was just spitballing.
</p><timestamp>00:11:24</timestamp>
<p>I didn't know you were gonna put me
on the spot like this!
</p><timestamp>00:11:26</timestamp>
<p>Come on, buddy.
What was so special about that moment?
</p><timestamp>00:11:29</timestamp>
<p>It felt good to help someone do something.
</p><timestamp>00:11:31</timestamp>
<p>See? Helping someone, like I said!
</p><timestamp>00:11:33</timestamp>
<p>But he liked it because it felt good,
like I said!
</p><timestamp>00:11:37</timestamp>
<p>I liked it because it reminded me
of when I was young, just starting out.
</p><timestamp>00:11:41</timestamp>
<p>You and me, screwing around,
hitting up open mics.
</p><timestamp>00:11:43</timestamp>
<p>Trying to figure it out. I think...
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p>-I think that was the best part.
-Really?
</p><timestamp>00:11:47</timestamp>
<p>Well, are we ready to start the show?
</p><timestamp>00:11:50</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Corduroy</subtitle> Let's do this!
-Okay, nice seeing you all!
</p><timestamp>00:11:52</timestamp>
<p>You're not coming?
</p><timestamp>00:11:53</timestamp>
<p>This is always the part where I wake up.
You all go to the show.
</p><timestamp>00:11:56</timestamp>
<p>Zach Braff says "Pardon my reach"
even though he can clearly
get my plate from another angle.
</p><timestamp>00:12:00</timestamp>
<p>-Then I wake up.
-Oh, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:12:03</timestamp>

<p>What do you say, huh?
Should we get this show started?
</p><timestamp>00:12:30</timestamp>
<p>Yeah! Tonight's opener
needs no introduction,
but I'm gonna give her one anyway.
</p><timestamp>00:12:34</timestamp>

to the man of the hour, BoJack Horseman!
</p><timestamp>00:12:48</timestamp>
<p>Sarah Lynn, I'm so sorry
for everything that happened with you.
</p><timestamp>00:12:52</timestamp>
<p>With us. I should have protected you...
</p><timestamp>00:12:54</timestamp>
<p>Ah, ah, ah. BoJack. This is my time.
</p><timestamp>00:12:56</timestamp>
<p>Yes. Of course. Sorry.

<p>So, what's on the other side of that door?
</p><timestamp>00:15:20</timestamp>
<p>The nerve of that guy.
With the beard. Herb?
</p><timestamp>00:15:22</timestamp>
<p>Yeah. Herb.
</p><timestamp>00:15:24</timestamp>
<p>What, he says he's at peace?
'Cause why, Machu Picchu?
</p><timestamp>00:15:27</timestamp>
<p>-I don't buy it.
-I don't know. I... I believe him.
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p>I promise you,
every single person in that room
would go back if we could.
</p><timestamp>00:15:32</timestamp>
<p>Peace? That's someone
trying to convince himself of something.
</p><timestamp>00:15:35</timestamp>
<p>-Of what?
-That life has meaning or purpose, that...
that if you check the right boxes
and do the dance,
then you get a little parting gift
at the end,
a framed certificate that says,
"Congratulations, you've got peace."
</p><timestamp>00:15:47</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:15:48</timestamp>
<p>-I wouldn't mind that.
-But guess what?
</p><timestamp>00:15:50</timestamp>
<p>All the time those people spent,
trying to do good or help people
or be something?
</p><timestamp>00:15:55</timestamp>
<p>I did none of that shit,
and yet here I am, same as them.
</p><timestamp>00:15:58</timestamp>
<p>You were the fastest runner in the world.
You inspired millions.
</p><timestamp>00:16:02</timestamp>
<p>And yet, here I am, same as you.
</p><timestamp>00:16:04</timestamp>
<p>So, if you could go back, do it again,
what would you do different?
</p><timestamp>00:16:07</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> What would I do?
I wouldn't have cared so much.
</p><timestamp>00:16:10</timestamp>
<p>Cared about what? Racing?
</p><timestamp>00:16:13</timestamp>
<p>About everything.
</p><timestamp>00:16:14</timestamp>
<p>I know this part is confusing
because I'm Secretariat
and also your dad for some reason,
but speaking as your dad,
it's important that you know that I cared.
</p><timestamp>00:16:23</timestamp>
<p>No. You never cared.
You cared about your book.
</p><timestamp>00:16:26</timestamp>
<p>You cared about getting drunk
and telling everyone
how miserable you were,
but that's not caring.
</p><timestamp>00:16:30</timestamp>
<p>You think I didn't care
because I put up walls,
but I cared so much, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:16:34</timestamp>
<p>About you, about your mother.
</p><timestamp>00:16:37</timestamp>
<p>I wanted you to respect me.
I wanted you to love me.
</p><timestamp>00:16:41</timestamp>
<p>I was so afraid that you would know that.
</p><timestamp>00:16:44</timestamp>
<p>I cared so much.
</p><timestamp>00:16:47</timestamp>
<p>It's a shame that we could never
talk like this in real life.
</p><timestamp>00:16:50</timestamp>
<p>All the good it would have done.
</p><timestamp>00:16:52</timestamp>
<p>Least we got the chance this time,
before I wake up.
</p><timestamp>00:16:54</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:16:56</timestamp>
<p>Wake up?
Oh, you're not getting it, are you?
</p><timestamp>00:16:58</timestamp>
<p>Getting what?
</p><timestamp>00:17:07</timestamp>
<p>Loss is a collaborative art,
between the people who leave us
and those who remain.
</p><timestamp>00:17:12</timestamp>
<p>We dance with the shadows
of their absence.
</p><timestamp>00:17:15</timestamp>
<p>-With that in mind, I present to you...
-<subtitle>grunts</subtitle> Stop the show!
</p><timestamp>00:17:18</timestamp>
<p>-Excuse me.
-What's happening?
</p><timestamp>00:17:20</timestamp>
<p>You're being very rude.
I was about to do my roller-dance routine.
</p><timestamp>00:17:24</timestamp>
<p>-Calm down, son.
-Yes, why don't you sit down, and--
</p><timestamp>00:17:28</timestamp>
<p>-No!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no. Please!
</p><timestamp>00:17:30</timestamp>
<p>I'm not ready. I never got to direct
my <i>Backdraft</i> remake:
</p><timestamp>00:17:32</timestamp>
<p>"Zach Braff's Backdraft"!
</p><timestamp>00:17:34</timestamp>
<p>I never finished my memoir:
</p><timestamp>00:17:35</timestamp>
<p>"I Started A Zach Which Started
The Whole World Braffing!"
</p><timestamp>00:17:38</timestamp>
<p>I never got to license
the Zach Braff Short Stack

</p><timestamp>00:17:42</timestamp>
<p>Cash-strapped hash brown fans
who hashtag "Zach's snacks"
get cash back fast
with the Braff Bucks app!
</p><timestamp>00:17:51</timestamp>
<p>I need to wake up. I can't be here.
</p><timestamp>00:17:53</timestamp>
<p>Of course. Everything's always about you.
</p><timestamp>00:17:55</timestamp>
<p>-BJ, buddy...
-Herb! How did I get here?
</p><timestamp>00:17:58</timestamp>
<p>How the hell should I know?
</p><timestamp>00:18:00</timestamp>
<p>I broke into my house.
But it wasn't my house anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:18:03</timestamp>
<p>I was... I was watching
the "Horsin' Around" Blu-ray.
</p><timestamp>00:18:05</timestamp>
<p>Yes. Yeah, and I drank some more
and I found some pills.
</p><timestamp>00:18:08</timestamp>
<p>And then I went swimming...
</p><timestamp>00:18:10</timestamp>
<p>No! No! No! No, wait, wait, wait!
I got out of the pool.
</p><timestamp>00:18:12</timestamp>
<p>Yes! And I called Diane!
</p><timestamp>00:18:14</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, we're trying to do a show here.
</p><timestamp>00:18:15</timestamp>
<p>But I called Diane.
</p><timestamp>00:18:17</timestamp>
<p>I couldn't have drowned
if I got out of the pool to call Diane!
</p><timestamp>00:18:19</timestamp>
<p>So, I shouldn't be here.
</p><timestamp>00:18:20</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>stammers</subtitle> If I could just finish
the conversation. Where's a phone?!
</p><timestamp>00:18:23</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>pants</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:26</timestamp>
<p>All right, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a real treat for you next.
</p><timestamp>00:18:29</timestamp>
<p>A real treat.
</p><timestamp>00:18:30</timestamp>
<p>Come and see him
before he makes a run for it.
</p><timestamp>00:18:32</timestamp>
<p>-No! Stop!
-It's Secretariat!
</p><timestamp>00:18:36</timestamp>
<p>Stay calm. Flyin' off the handle
won't change a thing.
</p><timestamp>00:18:38</timestamp>
<p>This was gonna happen to you
one of these days.
</p><timestamp>00:18:41</timestamp>
<p>A poem. Original, obviously.
</p><timestamp>00:18:43</timestamp>
<p>It's called "The View from Halfway Down."
<subtitle>clears throat</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:47</timestamp>
<p>"The weak breeze whispers nothing
The water screams sublime
</p><timestamp>00:18:51</timestamp>
<p>His feet shift teeter-totter
Deep breath, stand back, it's time
</p><timestamp>00:18:55</timestamp>
<p>Toes untouch the overpass
Soon he's water bound

Diane, you're gonna save me, right?

<p>I called you

<p>-You didn't pick up.

</p><timestamp>00:24:00</timestamp>
<p>-It went to voicemail.

</p><timestamp>00:24:03</timestamp>
