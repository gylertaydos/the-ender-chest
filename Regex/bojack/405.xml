<p>Oh, no. No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
</p><timestamp>00:00:17</timestamp>
<p>Sorry to interrupt your lunch,
but there was another mass shooting.
</p><timestamp>00:00:21</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God, where?
</p><timestamp>00:00:22</timestamp>
<p>A town outside Tampa called--
</p><timestamp>00:00:24</timestamp>
<p>Not geographically, dipshit.
What's the location?
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p>What is it, a pharmacy? A haberdashery?
</p><timestamp>00:00:29</timestamp>
<p>-It was a shopping mall.
-No!
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>-<i>Ms. Taken</i> is coming out next month.
-I know, sir.
</p><timestamp>00:00:37</timestamp>
<p>The whole third act
revolves around Courtney Portnoy
shooting people in a mall.
</p><timestamp>00:00:40</timestamp>
<p>What are we supposed to do now,
not release the movie?
</p><timestamp>00:00:43</timestamp>
<p>I hope it doesn't come to that.
</p><timestamp>00:00:45</timestamp>
<p>I am sick and tired
of real-life gun violence
getting in the way of us telling stories
that glamorize gun violence.
</p><timestamp>00:00:50</timestamp>
<p>Why does this keep happening?
Has the whole world gone crazy?
</p><timestamp>00:00:54</timestamp>
<p>No, we've just been conditioned
by a rugged individualist culture
woven into the savage architecture
of our country itself,
birthed as it was
through violent uprising,
but perhaps popularized
in the modern imagination by stories of--
</p><timestamp>00:01:05</timestamp>
<p>Okay, Chomsky, when I want you to talk,
</p><timestamp>00:01:07</timestamp>
<p>I'll staple a string to your back
and then yank it.
</p><timestamp>00:01:09</timestamp>
<p>Why not make yourself useful
and schedule a sit-down
with Courtney Portnoy's team
to talk about how we distance ourselves
from this <i>fakakte mishegoss.</i>

<p>-I have no idea who your mother is.

</p><timestamp>00:02:50</timestamp>
<p>I don't want to have a relationship
lying to each other.
</p><timestamp>00:02:52</timestamp>
<p>Okay, so why did you lie to me?
</p><timestamp>00:02:54</timestamp>
<p>I meant everything else I said.
</p><timestamp>00:02:55</timestamp>
<p>I'll do everything I can
to help find your mom.
</p><timestamp>00:02:57</timestamp>
<p>To be honest, moms aren't all that great.
</p><timestamp>00:03:00</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}In fact, in my experience,
they're soulless succubi
</p><timestamp>00:03:02</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}born fully formed from the ass of Satan.
</p><timestamp>00:03:03</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my grandmother
sounds like quite a character.
</p><timestamp>00:03:06</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Can I meet her?
-Oh, my mom?
</p><timestamp>00:03:07</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}No, you cannot meet my mom
because she's... dead.
</p><timestamp>00:03:11</timestamp>
<p>-Oh.
-Dead mom.
</p><timestamp>00:03:15</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}BoJack, what happened
to the fudgesicles I bought?
</p><timestamp>00:03:18</timestamp>
<p>-I lied again. My mom's not dead.
-Stop lying to me!
</p><timestamp>00:03:21</timestamp>
<p>That was, like, 15 minutes of lie.
Plus, you don't want to meet my mom.
</p><timestamp>00:03:24</timestamp>
<p>I do. Where does she live?
</p><timestamp>00:03:26</timestamp>
<p>Oh, this spectacular elder care facility,

</p><timestamp>00:03:38</timestamp>
<p>I want to say Whispering Pines.
Whistling Pines?

<p>{\an8}I am not gonna lie to you ever again.
</p><timestamp>00:03:52</timestamp>
<p>-Did you eat the last fudgesicle?

<p>This is so sad.

<p>{\an8}Tragedy like this
really puts things in perspective.

<p>{\an8}Like, what are we doing
sitting in a conference room?
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Life is short. We should have
this meeting at a water park.
</p><timestamp>00:04:37</timestamp>
<p>Whoa! A water park
where people have meetings.
</p><timestamp>00:04:40</timestamp>
<p>-Maybe that's the movie.
-I'm sorry, who is this schmuck?
</p><timestamp>00:04:42</timestamp>
<p>I'm Courtney's asexual fake fiancé.
</p><timestamp>00:04:44</timestamp>
<p>He's a common person/supermodel,
being engaged to him makes me appear
more approachable/glamorous.
</p><timestamp>00:04:49</timestamp>
<p>Okay-slash-whatever. We still have time
to cut the mall shootout from the film.
</p><timestamp>00:04:53</timestamp>
<p>That still leaves
the movie theater shootout,
</p><timestamp>00:04:55</timestamp>
<p>-the shootout at the county fair, the--
-<subtitle>vibrations and buzzing</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:04:58</timestamp>
<p>We should probably lose
the movie theater shootout.
</p><timestamp>00:05:01</timestamp>
<p>Right. Well, we still have
the county fair shootout.

<p>I gotta take this.

<p>-<i>BoJack?</i>
-Hi.
</p><timestamp>00:05:10</timestamp>
<p>-Where have you been?
<i>-Listen.</i>
</p><timestamp>00:05:12</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry.
I was an awful boyfriend to you.
</p><timestamp>00:05:14</timestamp>
<p>I was an awful client,
and I was an awful friend.
</p><timestamp>00:05:17</timestamp>
<p>This last year I spent some time away
and it made me realize
how special the people in my life are.
</p><timestamp>00:05:23</timestamp>
<p><i>And you might be</i>

</p><timestamp>00:05:25</timestamp>
<p>Wow, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
I-- I appreciate that.
</p><timestamp>00:05:28</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is,
do you remember the name
of that super nice elder care facility
that we both agreed was the best place
for my mom to run out the clock?
</p><timestamp>00:05:38</timestamp>
<p>Oh, pluck a duck.
It's called Walnut Springs.
</p><timestamp>00:05:40</timestamp>
<p>Walnut Springs!

<p>I feel like I didn't strike the right tone
in the last phone call.
</p><timestamp>00:05:48</timestamp>
<p>I really am sorry,
and the most important thing is,
you know how dedicated I am
to making things right again.
</p><timestamp>00:05:52</timestamp>
<p>Okay. Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:05:54</timestamp>
<p>Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is,
turns out there's a few Walnut Springses
in the SoCal area.
</p><timestamp>00:05:58</timestamp>
<p>It's the one in Santa Barbara, dummy!

to curtail gun violence.

<p>I'm just saying,
if people have the right pumped-up kicks,
maybe they can outrun the bullets.

<p>All this talk of gun violence
is depressing.

<p>-Hi, Mom.
-Do I know you?

<p>Here we go.
Yes, Mom, I never visit. You got me.
</p><timestamp>00:08:16</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:08:18</timestamp>
<p>I think she really doesn't know
who you are.
</p><timestamp>00:08:20</timestamp>
<p>She knows.
This is just like when she pretended
not to recognize me
after my shaky choir solo in eighth grade.
</p><timestamp>00:08:25</timestamp>
<p>I had to get a ride home with the pianist
who liked to tickle a lot more
than just the ivories.

"Huh. I guess no one wants you."

<p>You're not being paid

<p>I must apologize for Henrietta.
She learned to read on secondhand books.

<p>Mom, do you really not know who I am?
Me, famous BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:08:55</timestamp>
<p>If you are getting orange juice,
I'd love a glass too.
</p><timestamp>00:08:58</timestamp>
<p>Oh. Uh, okay.
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>So you see
I'm really quite ordinary and relatable.
</p><timestamp>00:09:07</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, you put your pants on
one leg at a time.
</p><timestamp>00:09:09</timestamp>
<p>Well, I step into my pants
one leg at a time,
then my trouser-maidens lift the legs
simultaneously to avoid wrinklage.
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>Well, right, of course,
why else have trouser-maidens?

it's Japanese for hello.
</p><timestamp>00:09:27</timestamp>
<p>Second, I'm not Japanese.
</p><timestamp>00:09:28</timestamp>
<p>Maybe I could put something

</p><timestamp>00:09:30</timestamp>
<p>-so you don't have to talk so much.
-Whoa!
</p><timestamp>00:09:33</timestamp>
<p>One more step, asshole.
</p><timestamp>00:09:34</timestamp>
<p>-What...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
</p><timestamp>00:09:36</timestamp>
<p>I was joking.
I don't want any trouble.
</p><timestamp>00:09:37</timestamp>
<p>-Tell your story walking.
-...the...
shit was that?
</p><timestamp>00:09:42</timestamp>
<p>I don't know! My instincts just kicked in.
</p><timestamp>00:09:45</timestamp>
<p>Why do you even have a gun?
</p><timestamp>00:09:47</timestamp>
<p>Well, using it in the movie
was so empowering,
and now I just carry it everywhere.
Do you want to hold it?
</p><timestamp>00:09:52</timestamp>
<p>No, I am very anti-gun.
</p><timestamp>00:09:54</timestamp>
<p>In fact, I think the whole idea of guns
is inherently--
</p><timestamp>00:09:57</timestamp>
<p>Holy shit, I'm holding a gun.
How long has this been in my hand?
</p><timestamp>00:10:00</timestamp>
<p>-Slides right in, doesn't it?
-It actually feels kind of nice.
</p><timestamp>00:10:03</timestamp>
<p>Would you like to try shooting it?
We can go to my gun range.
</p><timestamp>00:10:06</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:10:46</timestamp>

but the number you gave us

<p>One day, you're gonna be

why are you holding a gun?
</p><timestamp>00:11:51</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my God!

<p>Oh, and I'm being told by our producers

</p><timestamp>00:14:08</timestamp>
<p>-there has been another mass shooting.

</p><timestamp>00:14:11</timestamp>

<p>Princess Carolyn, if this keeps up,
we're gonna have to put this movie

about the klutzy babysitter.

you just described.
</p><timestamp>00:14:37</timestamp>
<p>Okay, what do all these shootings
have in common?
</p><timestamp>00:14:39</timestamp>
<p>Guns? Bullets? Who are you,
Art Linkletter? Just spit it out.
</p><timestamp>00:14:41</timestamp>
<p>Men! What if we played up
the "Ms." in <i>Ms. Taken</i>?
</p><timestamp>00:14:45</timestamp>
<p>In a world of increasing terror,
our movie tells women
they don't have to be afraid anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:14:50</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah, now you're talking.
-When you put it that way,
it almost sounds like these mass shootings
could be a good thing for the movie.
</p><timestamp>00:14:56</timestamp>
<p>No, no, no, of course not.
They're a terrible tragedy.
</p><timestamp>00:14:59</timestamp>
<p>Thoughts and prayers
are with the victims.
</p><timestamp>00:15:01</timestamp>
<p>-Right, thoughts and prayers.
-But...
anything that makes women feel unsafe
might actually help our box office.
</p><timestamp>00:15:07</timestamp>
<p>But you don't want women to feel unsafe.
</p><timestamp>00:15:10</timestamp>
<p>Of course not!
</p><timestamp>00:15:11</timestamp>
<p>Nobody wants that,
nobody's saying that.
</p><timestamp>00:15:13</timestamp>
<p>But if they already <i>do</i> feel unsafe,
there's no reason not to capitalize.
</p><timestamp>00:15:17</timestamp>
<p>Right, if they already feel unsafe anyway.
</p><timestamp>00:15:19</timestamp>
<p>Exactly, we're not making them
feel unsafe.
</p><timestamp>00:15:22</timestamp>
<p>We're just profiting, albeit indirectly,

<p>Or I thought I did. Or I still do, mostly.

</p><timestamp>00:20:24</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}not compliment
random women on the street
</p><timestamp>00:20:27</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}because they might be
carrying a gun?
</p><timestamp>00:20:29</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}We cannot allow our lives
to be dictated by that kind of fear.
</p><timestamp>00:20:33</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So you see, the trigger was specifically
designed for a man's grip
</p><timestamp>00:20:38</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and a man's temperament.
</p><timestamp>00:20:40</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Look, all I'm saying is
</p><timestamp>00:20:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}maybe you shouldn't blame women
for wanting guns.
</p><timestamp>00:20:44</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Maybe you should blame
the constant societal messaging
</p><timestamp>00:20:47</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}that tells us we are safe only as long
as the men around us allow us to be.
</p><timestamp>00:20:52</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}So if you have a problem
with women carrying firearms,
</p><timestamp>00:20:55</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}you can roll up your sleeves
and actually work to create a society
</p><timestamp>00:20:58</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}where women feel safe and equal,
or you can just ban all guns.

<p>We did it, boys.

<p>-Huzzah!
-Yes!
</p><timestamp>00:21:13</timestamp>
<p>-Congratulations!

</p><timestamp>00:21:16</timestamp>
<p>I thought that was gonna go the other way.
</p><timestamp>00:21:18</timestamp>
<p>Wow, Diane.
You just passed sensible gun legislation.
</p><timestamp>00:21:22</timestamp>
<p>I can't believe this country hates women
more than it loves guns.
</p><timestamp>00:21:25</timestamp>
<p>No?
</p><timestamp>00:21:30</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, I don't know about this.
</p><timestamp>00:21:32</timestamp>
<p>You'll be fine.
Just remember to enunciate.
</p><timestamp>00:21:34</timestamp>
<p>It helps if you imagine
performing for the back row.

<p>Olivia, you usually love

<p>It's this algebra homework

<p>Henrietta, what are you doing?
</p><timestamp>00:22:02</timestamp>
<p>BoJack, maybe we should stop.
</p><timestamp>00:22:04</timestamp>
<p>We just started. Let's at least
get through the first act
before we judge ourselves
too harshly, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:22:08</timestamp>
<p>I wonder if there's a way

<p>You think we should
still finish the episode, or...?
</p><timestamp>00:22:51</timestamp>
<p>Our insurance policy
is very strict and very clear.
</p><timestamp>00:22:54</timestamp>
<p>Once a resident becomes violent,
we can no longer house them.
</p><timestamp>00:22:57</timestamp>
<p>Can you recommend another facility?
</p><timestamp>00:22:59</timestamp>
<p>Frankly, at your mother's rate
of deterioration,
she probably doesn't have much time.
</p><timestamp>00:23:02</timestamp>
<p>I recommend she spend it surrounded
by the people who care about her.
</p><timestamp>00:23:05</timestamp>
<p>Okay, who are they?
Do you have their number?
</p><timestamp>00:23:07</timestamp>
<p>-I was referring to you and your daughter.
-Oh. Uh...
</p><timestamp>00:23:10</timestamp>
<p>We'll take her.
She can have the guest room,
</p><timestamp>00:23:12</timestamp>
<p>-and I can sleep on the couch. Right?
-<subtitle>groans</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:23:15</timestamp>
<p>Okay. If she really doesn't have
much time left.
</p><timestamp>00:23:18</timestamp>
<p>But if we get to this time next year,
she's still hanging on,
you will be getting
a very strongly worded letter, mister.

<p>That's all we got,
once we took out all the guns.
</p><timestamp>00:23:31</timestamp>
<p>Maybe it could work
as an H&amp;amp;M commercial?
</p><timestamp>00:23:33</timestamp>
<p>It's a shame. It was a great movie.
</p><timestamp>00:23:35</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Yeah.
Cut down in the prime of its life.
</p><timestamp>00:23:37</timestamp>
<p>Well, I'm very sorry for your loss.
</p><timestamp>00:23:41</timestamp>
<p>Eh, I'll be fine.
</p><timestamp>00:23:45</timestamp>
<p>Hey, Beatrice, you hungry?
I could make Pop-Tarts.

</p><timestamp>00:23:56</timestamp>
<p>Oh, God.
</p><timestamp>00:24:06</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry you didn't get
to tell your mom off.
</p><timestamp>00:24:08</timestamp>
<p>I keep thinking
about all the things I never said
because I was so sure
there'd be other days to say them.
</p><timestamp>00:24:13</timestamp>
<p>-Why don't you tell her now?
-It's not the same.
</p><timestamp>00:24:15</timestamp>
<p>I should have done it
back when she knew who I was,
back when it would mean something.
</p><timestamp>00:24:19</timestamp>
<p>But now, she's gonna die
and she's never gonna know
just how much I hate her.
</p><timestamp>00:24:22</timestamp>
<p>I'm sure she knew, BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:24:25</timestamp>
<p>-Yeah? You're not just saying that?
-She read your book, didn't she?
</p><timestamp>00:24:28</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Yeah, but I really wanted
to say it to her face.
</p><timestamp>00:24:31</timestamp>
<p>Well, hey, she's here now, right?
And she has good days and bad days.
</p><timestamp>00:24:36</timestamp>
<p>Maybe, eventually, she'll recognize you.
And then you can totally rip into her.
</p><timestamp>00:24:42</timestamp>
