<p>Slow down, Henrietta.
A lady mustn't rush. It's unbecoming.
</p><timestamp>00:00:15</timestamp>
<p>I am not Henrietta! I'm your son!
</p><timestamp>00:00:17</timestamp>
<p>My son is a ball of gas.
</p><timestamp>00:00:19</timestamp>
<p>Yes! Your son, BoJack. I'm him.
I'm the ball of gas!
</p><timestamp>00:00:23</timestamp>
<p>But you're also a star.
</p><timestamp>00:00:26</timestamp>
<p>Wait. Mom, do you remember--
</p><timestamp>00:00:27</timestamp>
<p>Shh! Henrietta, I am talking to the sun.
</p><timestamp>00:00:30</timestamp>
<p>Sun, you're a ball of gas,
but you're also a star.
</p><timestamp>00:00:34</timestamp>
<p>-We call you... "Sun."
-Ugh!
</p><timestamp>00:00:36</timestamp>
<p>Where are you taking me?
Are we going to the lake house?
</p><timestamp>00:00:39</timestamp>
<p>No, we're going
to a glorious magical place
where they'll lock you
in a room by yourself
so you can't hurt anyone ever again.
</p><timestamp>00:00:47</timestamp>
<p>Oh, that sounds lovely.
Why are you driving so slowly?
</p><timestamp>00:00:50</timestamp>
<p>-Hurry up!
-Wait. You just said--
</p><timestamp>00:00:51</timestamp>
<p>Time's arrow neither stands still
nor reverses, after all.
</p><timestamp>00:00:55</timestamp>
<p>It merely marches forward.
Isn't that right, Henrietta?
</p><timestamp>00:01:00</timestamp>
<p>Yes, Mrs. Horseman. That's right.

<p>{\an8}We three are members

<p>{\an8}led by I,

</p><timestamp>00:02:41</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}You may not enter.
</p><timestamp>00:02:42</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}-Yeah, and also you're fat.

</p><timestamp>00:02:45</timestamp>
<p>I'm not fat. <subtitle>coughs</subtitle>

<p>{\an8}She's saying your lungs
think you're fat too.
</p><timestamp>00:02:54</timestamp>
<p>Father says I'm just growing.

<p>I don't care if you're scared

you have to go to school.

<p>{\an8}Now stop making books your friends.

a mother's duty to keep her children alive
</p><timestamp>00:03:48</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}and you are continually failing!
</p><timestamp>00:03:50</timestamp>
<p>How could you not have known
she has scarlet fever?
</p><timestamp>00:03:53</timestamp>
<p>Say something, damn it!
What has become of you?
</p><timestamp>00:03:55</timestamp>
<p>I swear if I'd known
this is how you'd behave
once we severed the connections
to your prefrontal cortex,
</p><timestamp>00:04:01</timestamp>
<p>I'd hardly have bothered.
</p><timestamp>00:04:02</timestamp>
<p>-Father?
-<subtitle>gasps</subtitle> Yes, darling?
</p><timestamp>00:04:05</timestamp>
<p>Am I to die?
</p><timestamp>00:04:06</timestamp>
<p>Well, eventually yes,
but this illness is but a hiccup
in what will be a long and happy life,
</p><timestamp>00:04:11</timestamp>
<p>-I promise.
-You promise?
</p><timestamp>00:04:12</timestamp>
<p>In fact, some good
may yet come of this.
</p><timestamp>00:04:14</timestamp>
<p>Doctor says your throat
is nearly swollen shut.
</p><timestamp>00:04:17</timestamp>
<p>So perhaps you'll finally lose
some of that weight
that's given you such troubles.
</p><timestamp>00:04:20</timestamp>
<p>-Won't that be nice?
-Yes, Father.
</p><timestamp>00:04:26</timestamp>
<p>-Ow!
-Suck in, Miss Sugarman, please.
</p><timestamp>00:04:28</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Polly, be a darling and fetch me
a pretty pill
and a glass of water, won't you?
</p><timestamp>00:04:32</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Yes, Señorita Sugarman.
</p><timestamp>00:04:34</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}Beatrice, you're looking well,
which is just fine,
</p><timestamp>00:04:36</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}because your debutante party
is vitally important.
</p><timestamp>00:04:39</timestamp>
<p>Will it end poverty, war and injustice,
or bring back civil rights
activist Medgar Evers,
who was shot in Mississippi
this week?
</p><timestamp>00:04:46</timestamp>
<p>Yes! Or rather, it will end you
worrying about that nonsense
because it will land you a husband.
</p><timestamp>00:04:51</timestamp>
<p>{\an8}At least Evers' death means no one else
will be assassinated this year, 1963.
</p><timestamp>00:04:57</timestamp>
<p>The FBI is on too high alert to allow
anything like that to happen again.
</p><timestamp>00:05:01</timestamp>
<p>-Hmm?
-Yes... well...
</p><timestamp>00:05:03</timestamp>
<p>Your chaperone,
Corbin Creamerman,
is a fine young man.
</p><timestamp>00:05:06</timestamp>
<p>Oh, jeez.
</p><timestamp>00:05:08</timestamp>
<p>-My lady. <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> Here you go.
-Thanks.
</p><timestamp>00:05:14</timestamp>
<p>So... uh, you look nice.
</p><timestamp>00:05:18</timestamp>
<p>Thank you, Corbin.
That's the third time you've told me.
</p><timestamp>00:05:21</timestamp>
<p>You needn't tell me again.
</p><timestamp>00:05:22</timestamp>
<p>Oh, jeez. I'm sorry.
I'm not always good at these things.
</p><timestamp>00:05:26</timestamp>
<p>But sometimes I am.
I can be. I-- I really try to be.
</p><timestamp>00:05:29</timestamp>
<p>I'm, well, I-- I'm not. I'm really not.
I don't know why.
</p><timestamp>00:05:32</timestamp>
<p>Ah, that's all right. I'm not either.
</p><timestamp>00:05:35</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>Joseph</subtitle>
Corbin's father, Mort Creamerman,
is founder of Creamerman's
Creamy Cream-based Commodities.
</p><timestamp>00:05:40</timestamp>
<p>Think of all the free iced cream
you could, uh, serve to other people.
</p><timestamp>00:05:44</timestamp>
<p>Father, do you aim to marry me off
to Corbin Creamerman
merely because it would be good
for business?
</p><timestamp>00:05:49</timestamp>
<p>Well, I suppose I do have a few ideas
of how a Sugarman/Creamerman
alliance might be advantageous.
</p><timestamp>00:05:54</timestamp>
<p>-Uh-huh.
-For example,
imagine a television advertisement
with a fun jingle.
</p><timestamp>00:05:58</timestamp>
<p><music> Have your morning coffee or tea</music>
</p><timestamp>00:06:01</timestamp>
<p><music> With Sugarman and Creamerman</music>
</p><timestamp>00:06:03</timestamp>
<p><music> But save some for... these fellas</music>
</p><timestamp>00:06:05</timestamp>
<p>And then it's Mort and me,
and we're holding up our products
with big smiles from across
a very ordinary looking kitchen table.
</p><timestamp>00:06:11</timestamp>
<p>Father, common Americans
don't want you on their TV sets.
</p><timestamp>00:06:14</timestamp>
<p>You're a reminder of the disparity
of wealth in this country.
</p><timestamp>00:06:18</timestamp>
<p>Poor people find that dreadfully gauche.
</p><timestamp>00:06:20</timestamp>
<p>You know, I sent you to Barnard
to get your MRS
from a fine upstanding Columbia man,
but instead of a bachelor
you returned home
with a bachelor's degree
and a mouth full of sass.
</p><timestamp>00:06:30</timestamp>
<p>What a waste!
</p><timestamp>00:06:32</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:34</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>Corbin</subtitle> <i>You look nice.</i>
-Thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:06:36</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my... Beatrice Sugarman?
Doth my eye belie me?
</p><timestamp>00:06:41</timestamp>
<p>Oh, Clemelia Bloodsworth.
Why are you here?
</p><timestamp>00:06:45</timestamp>
<p>I must say,
it's tremendous you're finally debuting.
</p><timestamp>00:06:49</timestamp>
<p>Better late than never, hmm?
<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:06:51</timestamp>
<p>Ugh! I'm only doing this for my father,
who has very old-fashioned ideas
about how a woman is to live her life.
</p><timestamp>00:06:57</timestamp>
<p>Poor Corbin here is saddled
with chaperoning me.
</p><timestamp>00:07:00</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I don't feel saddled.
</p><timestamp>00:07:02</timestamp>
<p>In truth,
I find these parties to be garish,
self-serving wastes of money.
</p><timestamp>00:07:06</timestamp>
<p>Oh, and I'm sure yours
was particularly horrendous, Clemelia.
</p><timestamp>00:07:10</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>spits and coughs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:11</timestamp>
<p>Oh, my! How repugnant!
</p><timestamp>00:07:17</timestamp>
<p>Uh... scotch on the rocks.
</p><timestamp>00:07:21</timestamp>
<p>-Do I know you?
-<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:23</timestamp>
<p>Nope, just crashing some dumb
debutante's party. <subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:07:26</timestamp>
<p>Oh, do you mean for "dumb"
to describe the party or the debutante?
</p><timestamp>00:07:30</timestamp>
<p>Because I might agree with you,
or I might be offended.
</p><timestamp>00:07:33</timestamp>
<p>You're the dumb debutante, aren't you?
</p><timestamp>00:07:35</timestamp>
<p>Beatrice Sugarman.
Welcome to my dumb party.
</p><timestamp>00:07:38</timestamp>
<p>Butterscotch Horseman.
Charmed, I'm sure.
</p><timestamp>00:07:40</timestamp>
<p>You crash a lot of these?
</p><timestamp>00:07:41</timestamp>
<p>I'll take my free alcohol
where I can get it.
</p><timestamp>00:07:43</timestamp>
<p>Saving for California.
</p><timestamp>00:07:45</timestamp>
<p>What's in California?
</p><timestamp>00:07:46</timestamp>
<p>Ginsberg, Cassady, Squirrelinghetti.
</p><timestamp>00:07:48</timestamp>
<p>This is where you ask me
if those are towns, and I smirk at you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:51</timestamp>
<p>I am familiar with the Beats,
thank you.
</p><timestamp>00:07:53</timestamp>
<p>I like Ginsberg all right,
but if you ask me,
that Squirrelinghetti is nuts.
</p><timestamp>00:07:58</timestamp>
<p>-What's your interest in them?
-What's my interest?
</p><timestamp>00:08:00</timestamp>
<p>They're the greatest minds
of our generation.
</p><timestamp>00:08:02</timestamp>
<p>I'm heading west to join them,
because I'm one of the greatest minds too.
</p><timestamp>00:08:06</timestamp>
<p>-I see.
-You will see.
</p><timestamp>00:08:07</timestamp>
<p>I'm writing the next
Great American Novel.
</p><timestamp>00:08:09</timestamp>
<p>Oh, what's it about?
</p><timestamp>00:08:11</timestamp>
<p>It's about truth! It's about war!
</p><timestamp>00:08:13</timestamp>
<p>It's about the twilighting frontier
of the lives that were promised us.
</p><timestamp>00:08:16</timestamp>
<p>But what is it about?
Who are the characters?
</p><timestamp>00:08:19</timestamp>
<p>I never claimed to have
the whole thing
sorted out just yet, did I?
</p><timestamp>00:08:22</timestamp>
<p>Sounds like a best seller.
</p><timestamp>00:08:23</timestamp>
<p>You're sarcastic, which is an ugly thing
for a woman to be.
</p><timestamp>00:08:26</timestamp>
<p>I don't know how you expect
to nab a husband at a party like this
with a personality like that.
</p><timestamp>00:08:30</timestamp>
<p>Oh, congratulations. You and my father
express the same concerns.
</p><timestamp>00:08:34</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>chuckles</subtitle> If I were your old man,
</p><timestamp>00:08:36</timestamp>
<p>I'd be anxious
to get you married off, too.
</p><timestamp>00:08:38</timestamp>
<p>I bet your thank-you letters
are perfunctory,
your flower arrangements
are uninspired,
and your curtsy is an embarrassment.
</p><timestamp>00:08:45</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>chuckles</subtitle>
-<subtitle>laughs</subtitle>

<p>What must your mother think of you?

<p>Oh, she doesn't think much...
about anything, anymore.
</p><timestamp>00:08:55</timestamp>
<p>Oh. I'm sorry, did... did she pass?
</p><timestamp>00:08:57</timestamp>
<p>-No, not exactly.
-Mine did.
</p><timestamp>00:09:00</timestamp>
<p>I'm very sorry to hear that.
</p><timestamp>00:09:02</timestamp>
<p>I was little. I don't remember, really.
</p><timestamp>00:09:04</timestamp>
<p>But she had a diamond just like yours.
I saw it in a picture once.
</p><timestamp>00:09:08</timestamp>
<p>Oh...
</p><timestamp>00:09:09</timestamp>
<p>-<subtitle>BoJack</subtitle> Yes, this is my mother.
-What?
</p><timestamp>00:09:11</timestamp>
<p>I'd like to leave her here.
</p><timestamp>00:09:12</timestamp>
<p>Can I pay for the next five years now
so I don't have to think about her again?
</p><timestamp>00:09:16</timestamp>
<p>-Wha-- Oh.
-<subtitle>Corbin</subtitle> Oh, jeez, I--
</p><timestamp>00:09:17</timestamp>
<p>I'm sorry to interrupt,
but we have to do the thing now,
where we do the... things.
</p><timestamp>00:09:23</timestamp>
<p>Oh-- oh, right. Um...
</p><timestamp>00:09:25</timestamp>
<p>-Please excuse me.
-Of course, it sounds very important.

<p>Why don't you come with me?

<p>It'll dispense with the need for goodbyes,
thus eliminating my transgression.
</p><timestamp>00:10:10</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:10:35</timestamp>
<p>Corbin Creamerman has come to call.
He'd like to take you for a Sunday stroll.
</p><timestamp>00:10:38</timestamp>
<p>I am not interested
in Corbin Creamerman.
</p><timestamp>00:10:41</timestamp>
<p>I don't give a damn
where your interests lie!
</p><timestamp>00:10:44</timestamp>
<p>After the disappearing act you pulled
at your own party,
you're lucky I don't fill a jar
with jellied beans
and marry you off to the man
who can closest estimate the amount.
</p><timestamp>00:10:52</timestamp>
<p>Heavens!
</p><timestamp>00:10:53</timestamp>
<p>Corbin Creamerman is willing
to give you a second chance,
he is downstairs waiting,
and you <i>will</i> be civil to him.
</p><timestamp>00:10:59</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>huffs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:11:00</timestamp>
<p>And the way they make
non-dairy creamer
is by replacing the milk fat
with vegetable oil.
</p><timestamp>00:11:06</timestamp>
<p>That's why it doesn't need refrigeration.
</p><timestamp>00:11:08</timestamp>
<p>-Pretty nifty, huh?
-Is that so?
</p><timestamp>00:11:11</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, jeez, I'm boring you.
-Not at all. I don't find <i>you</i> boring.
</p><timestamp>00:11:14</timestamp>
<p>Only the things you choose
to talk about,
and the way in which
you talk about them.
</p><timestamp>00:11:18</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I... I'm sorry. I...
I just get excited by food chemistry.
</p><timestamp>00:11:22</timestamp>
<p>You know, you take something
you thought you knew,
and then discover
there's so much more to it
than you could have possibly imagined.
</p><timestamp>00:11:27</timestamp>
<p>-It's like... magic.
-Oh?
</p><timestamp>00:11:30</timestamp>
<p>My father is less enchanted.
</p><timestamp>00:11:32</timestamp>
<p>He says it's just squeezing money
out of cow teats.
</p><timestamp>00:11:35</timestamp>
<p>I suppose that's true,
but I got ideas too,
and I feel I never get to be anything
other than what he expects me to be.
</p><timestamp>00:11:42</timestamp>
<p>You know what that's like?
</p><timestamp>00:11:44</timestamp>
<p>I do.
</p><timestamp>00:11:45</timestamp>
<p>You know, Corbin,
it occurs to me
that perhaps you and I aren't so--

</p><timestamp>00:12:12</timestamp>
<p>-Beatrice, what are you doing here?
-I had to look you up in the phone book.
</p><timestamp>00:12:17</timestamp>
<p>The number you gave me
was to a pizza parlor in Brownsburg.
</p><timestamp>00:12:21</timestamp>
<p>What? Are you sure?
</p><timestamp>00:12:22</timestamp>
<p>Butterscotch, I'm pregnant.
</p><timestamp>00:12:24</timestamp>
<p>-Wha--
-<subtitle>whistles</subtitle> Whoa, boy!
</p><timestamp>00:12:26</timestamp>
<p>Come on, Bopper,
can you give us some privacy?
</p><timestamp>00:12:28</timestamp>
<p>Sure thing, Butterscotch.
You take it easy.
</p><timestamp>00:12:30</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>whistling</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:12:31</timestamp>
<p>Are you certain it's mine?
</p><timestamp>00:12:33</timestamp>
<p>Well, whose else could it be?
</p><timestamp>00:12:35</timestamp>
<p>What do you wanna do?
Maybe you have a cousin,
who has a... a friend,
who knows a doctor,
who can take care
of such inconveniences?
</p><timestamp>00:12:41</timestamp>
<p>I'm-- I'm happy to do
the gentlemanly thing and...
and pay for the cab fare.
</p><timestamp>00:12:46</timestamp>
<p>No. I can't.
</p><timestamp>00:12:48</timestamp>
<p>Well, that doesn't leave us
with very many options.
</p><timestamp>00:12:51</timestamp>
<p>I'm a ruined woman.
</p><timestamp>00:12:52</timestamp>
<p>Don't be hysterical.
You're not ruined.
</p><timestamp>00:12:54</timestamp>
<p>It's a verifiable fact
you look more beautiful than ever.
</p><timestamp>00:12:57</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>scoffs</subtitle> Oh, what do you know?
</p><timestamp>00:13:00</timestamp>
<p>It was a pretty great night
we had together, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:13:02</timestamp>
<p>It was.
</p><timestamp>00:13:05</timestamp>
<p>Say, did you ever hear the story
of the couple who moved to California?
</p><timestamp>00:13:09</timestamp>
<p>I can't say that I have.
</p><timestamp>00:13:11</timestamp>
<p>Oh, it's a marvelous adventure.
</p><timestamp>00:13:12</timestamp>
<p>You see, they hardly knew each other,
but they shared a certain sensitivity
and a taste for the unknown.
</p><timestamp>00:13:17</timestamp>
<p>They were living in a one-horse town,
so they headed west,
towards a town that could
accommodate three horses.
</p><timestamp>00:13:23</timestamp>
<p>Oh, yes, I think I <i>have</i> heard this story.
</p><timestamp>00:13:25</timestamp>
<p>They got a small house
in San Francisco near the bookstore.
</p><timestamp>00:13:29</timestamp>
<p>He got in good with Squirrelinghetti
and his scurry.
</p><timestamp>00:13:31</timestamp>
<p>He wrote his Great American Novel...
</p><timestamp>00:13:33</timestamp>
<p>While his wife took care of the baby.
</p><timestamp>00:13:35</timestamp>
<p>His wife?
Oh, well, I didn't hear about that part.
</p><timestamp>00:13:39</timestamp>
<p>Well, if she'd have him.
</p><timestamp>00:13:41</timestamp>
<p>If a beautiful creature like herself
could ever love an oaf like him.
</p><timestamp>00:13:45</timestamp>
<p>-I think she could.
-Yeah?
</p><timestamp>00:13:47</timestamp>
<p>And isn't that how the story goes?

</p><timestamp>00:14:12</timestamp>
<p>I tried. He won't eat.
I don't know what he wants.
</p><timestamp>00:14:14</timestamp>
<p>Well, can you figure it out?
</p><timestamp>00:14:15</timestamp>
<p>If I don't sleep, how can I work
to support you and the child,
let alone have energy left over to write?
</p><timestamp>00:14:20</timestamp>
<p>Maybe if anyone wanted to pay you
for anything you wrote,
we'd be able to afford
a nanny and a maid.
</p><timestamp>00:14:25</timestamp>
<p>Well, if Squirrelinghetti
and his horde of commie, liberal,
</p><timestamp>00:14:28</timestamp>
<p>Jew-loving rejects
knew what good writing was,
</p><timestamp>00:14:30</timestamp>
<p>I'd be able to sell something.
</p><timestamp>00:14:31</timestamp>
<p>Oh, so they're all wrong,

<p>Why won't you just take
that corner office job at Sugarman West
instead of breaking your back
all day at the cannery,
and then maybe you could afford me
some decent help around here?
</p><timestamp>00:14:46</timestamp>
<p>You want me to work for your father,
and get paid for it,
like some sort of slave?
</p><timestamp>00:14:50</timestamp>
<p>-That is the opposite of slavery.
-Is it?
</p><timestamp>00:14:53</timestamp>
<p>Yes, it is!
You have no facility for language.

<p>-<subtitle>baby crying</subtitle>

</p><timestamp>00:15:00</timestamp>
<p>You wanted that baby.
Never forget that.

<p>I need quiet!

</p><timestamp>00:15:26</timestamp>
<p>Ugh! Terrible.
Those fish do not like being canned.
</p><timestamp>00:15:29</timestamp>
<p>Well, I burnt dinner, again.
</p><timestamp>00:15:31</timestamp>
<p>But you can pick
at the charred remains
and delight me and your simple son
with stories of your noble,
salt-of-the-earth co-workers

and Sports-Team Steve...
</p><timestamp>00:15:42</timestamp>
<p>-Oh, God.

</p><timestamp>00:15:44</timestamp>
<p>-in your study for the night...

</p><timestamp>00:15:45</timestamp>
<p>...to chip away at your
never-ending goddamn novel.
</p><timestamp>00:15:49</timestamp>
<p>I'll clean up the kitchen,
</p><timestamp>00:15:50</timestamp>
<p>-and bathe our filthy child.
-If you could just--
</p><timestamp>00:15:53</timestamp>
<p>And we'll just keep waltzing
</p><timestamp>00:15:54</timestamp>

-No--
</p><timestamp>00:15:57</timestamp>
<p>Maybe if the goddamn baby
wasn't crying all the time,
</p><timestamp>00:16:00</timestamp>
<p>I could finish the goddamn novel.
</p><timestamp>00:16:01</timestamp>
<p>I'm not a baby. I'm six.
</p><timestamp>00:16:03</timestamp>
<p>Yes, wah, wah, ga, ga, goo, goo.
</p><timestamp>00:16:05</timestamp>
<p>I'm forming sentences.
</p><timestamp>00:16:07</timestamp>
<p>Oh, and I can't? Everyone's a critic.
</p><timestamp>00:16:09</timestamp>
<p>I can see the headline now,
</p><timestamp>00:16:10</timestamp>
<p>"Idiot Son Thinks Dad's Book is Great,
comma, Son is Idiot."
</p><timestamp>00:16:14</timestamp>
<p>I didn't say your book is great.
</p><timestamp>00:16:15</timestamp>
<p>I can't live like this!
</p><timestamp>00:16:17</timestamp>
<p>I should have married
Corbin Creamerman.
</p><timestamp>00:16:19</timestamp>
<p>Ha! Like he'd have you.
</p><timestamp>00:16:20</timestamp>
<p>Oh, he would have.
And he would have been kind to me.
</p><timestamp>00:16:23</timestamp>
<p>And he wouldn't have been
too much of a stubborn ass
to take a decent job
at my father's company!
</p><timestamp>00:16:28</timestamp>
<p>Fine! I'll take the corner office,
with the company car, six-figure salary,
and four weeks paid vacation,
but if my novel becomes bad
because I no longer remember
what it's like to be working class,
we'll know of whom to be blamed.

<p>Henrietta, will you help me pack this?
I want to bring it to my son.
</p><timestamp>00:16:59</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>laughs</subtitle> Oh, that's so nice.
I love a good painting.
</p><timestamp>00:17:01</timestamp>
<p>It's like TV without all the talking
and movement.
</p><timestamp>00:17:04</timestamp>
<p>Jesus, what is that ghastly thing?
</p><timestamp>00:17:06</timestamp>
<p>It belonged to Father.
</p><timestamp>00:17:08</timestamp>
<p>I'm giving it to BoJack.
</p><timestamp>00:17:10</timestamp>
<p>I never cared for the aesthetic arts.
Dulls the senses.
</p><timestamp>00:17:12</timestamp>
<p>Art should be straightforward
and utilitarian, like my novel.
</p><timestamp>00:17:15</timestamp>
<p>I can't wait to read it.
</p><timestamp>00:17:17</timestamp>
<p>Books are fantastic.
The words tell stories.
</p><timestamp>00:17:20</timestamp>
<p>-Henrietta, the painting.
-Right away, Mrs. Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:17:23</timestamp>
<p>I shouldn't have to ask you twice.
</p><timestamp>00:17:24</timestamp>
<p>God gave you two ears
and me only the one mouth, after all.
</p><timestamp>00:17:29</timestamp>
<p>-You could be nicer to her.
-No one's ever nice to me.
</p><timestamp>00:17:32</timestamp>
<p>-Why should I be nice?
-Beatrice...
</p><timestamp>00:17:34</timestamp>
<p>Just because the maid
bats her little eyes at you
and makes barely-qualifying- 
for-conversation conversation,
doesn't mean I'm so easily seduced.
</p><timestamp>00:17:42</timestamp>
<p>I don't know
what you're insinuating. I--
</p><timestamp>00:17:44</timestamp>
<p>Oh, I'm sure she makes you feel
like a big smart man,
never challenges you,
and thanks you for helping her
study for nursing school.
</p><timestamp>00:17:53</timestamp>
<p>As a matter of fact,
she <i>is </i>studying for nursing.
</p><timestamp>00:17:55</timestamp>
<p>I know. I can hear
your flirting through the wall,
when you're supposedly
"working on your novel."
</p><timestamp>00:18:00</timestamp>
<p>I bet you think
she's falling in love with you.
</p><timestamp>00:18:02</timestamp>
<p>You sensitive, misunderstood artist.
Ugh. Won't she be disappointed.
</p><timestamp>00:18:07</timestamp>
<p>I don't know why you don't
just get a divorce already.
</p><timestamp>00:18:09</timestamp>
<p>Oh, sure, that's the Hollywood way.
</p><timestamp>00:18:11</timestamp>
<p>"We're out of mustard.
Let's get a divorce!"
</p><timestamp>00:18:12</timestamp>
<p>"I'm a little sad. Divorce!"
</p><timestamp>00:18:14</timestamp>
<p>"We've grown apart over the years
and our adult child
has moved out of the house
and there's no reason for us
to stay together. Divorce!"
</p><timestamp>00:18:20</timestamp>
<p>That actually is a legitimate reason
to get a divorce.
</p><timestamp>00:18:23</timestamp>
<p>Well, who else would have me now?
After what you did to my body?
</p><timestamp>00:18:26</timestamp>
<p>-What I did?
-Anyway, do you want this painting?
</p><timestamp>00:18:29</timestamp>
<p>It belonged to your grandfather,
a man who knew what marriage meant.
</p><timestamp>00:18:32</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>muffled dialogue</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:18:34</timestamp>
<p>Sure.
</p><timestamp>00:18:35</timestamp>
<p>I drove it all the way down here,
didn't I?
</p><timestamp>00:18:37</timestamp>
<p>-You might as well take it.
-I said I'll take it.
</p><timestamp>00:18:39</timestamp>
<p>Of course. Take.
That's all you ever do.
</p><timestamp>00:18:42</timestamp>
<p>How long you sticking around for, Mom?
</p><timestamp>00:18:44</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle> Just pour me a drink
and I'll be on my way.
</p><timestamp>00:18:46</timestamp>
<p>Yeah, let's get you good and liquored up
before you drive up the coast.
</p><timestamp>00:18:49</timestamp>
<p>I got a date with Tonya Harding tonight.
</p><timestamp>00:18:52</timestamp>
<p>She was the good one?
I always get them confused.
</p><timestamp>00:18:54</timestamp>
<p>I heard your show was canceled.
</p><timestamp>00:18:56</timestamp>
<p>Three years ago now.
You're really on the pulse, huh?
</p><timestamp>00:18:58</timestamp>
<p>I never understood the appeal.
</p><timestamp>00:19:00</timestamp>
<p>-It's just a bunch of silly stories.
-Some people like silly stories.
</p><timestamp>00:19:03</timestamp>
<p>Lotta good they ever did me.
</p><timestamp>00:19:05</timestamp>
<p>It's not Ibsen, but...
</p><timestamp>00:19:06</timestamp>
<p>It would only depress me
to watch you bumble around like that.
</p><timestamp>00:19:10</timestamp>
<p>All the sacrifices I made,
so that you could do this.
</p><timestamp>00:19:16</timestamp>
<p>Thanks for the painting.
</p><timestamp>00:19:17</timestamp>

<p>She wants to have the baby.
I-- I can't talk her out of it.

</p><timestamp>00:19:57</timestamp>
<p>You think I enjoy groveling
to my own wife, hat in hand?
</p><timestamp>00:19:59</timestamp>

in your wifely duties...
</p><timestamp>00:20:02</timestamp>

</p><timestamp>00:20:27</timestamp>
<p>He was just so kind to me
and I felt so--
</p><timestamp>00:20:29</timestamp>
<p>Let me guess, he said you reminded him
of his dead mother.
</p><timestamp>00:20:32</timestamp>
<p>He said she had hair like mine.
He saw it in a picture once.
</p><timestamp>00:20:37</timestamp>
<p><subtitle>sighs</subtitle>
</p><timestamp>00:20:38</timestamp>
<p>-Do you really want this child?

</p><timestamp>00:20:46</timestamp>
<p>I need help. I'm studying to be a nurse,

</p><timestamp>00:20:50</timestamp>
<p>None of that is my fault.
</p><timestamp>00:20:52</timestamp>
<p>If I can just finish school
and get a job, it'll be okay.
</p><timestamp>00:20:56</timestamp>
<p>And who's going to care
for the baby while you work?
</p><timestamp>00:20:58</timestamp>
<p>Because God knows he won't.

<p>I don't know what else to do,
Mrs. Horseman.
</p><timestamp>00:21:08</timestamp>
<p>All right. We'll pay for your tuition.
</p><timestamp>00:21:11</timestamp>

-Yes.

<p>Yes. That's right. What else?
</p><timestamp>00:24:18</timestamp>

<p>I can see it. It's so clear.
</p><timestamp>00:24:28</timestamp>
<p>What are we doing here, BoJack?
</p><timestamp>00:24:31</timestamp>
<p>We're sitting on the back porch,
and we're listening to your brother
play the piano,
and we're eating ice cream.
</p><timestamp>00:24:37</timestamp>
<p>Vanilla ice cream.
</p><timestamp>00:24:39</timestamp>
<p>Yes. That's right.
</p><timestamp>00:24:41</timestamp>
<p>Oh, it's all so marvelous.
